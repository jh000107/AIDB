(b) The instruction erroneously submitted to the jury the question of whether fire was the proximate cause of the loss and there was no evidence that the loss was caused by fire. Exchange Bank v. Insurance Co.,  218 Mo. App. 587 , 265 S.W. 855 ; Eaken v. Insurance Co., 242 S.W. 426 (Mo. App.), 44 A.L.R. 870, 65 A.L.R. 936; Caballero  Basualdo v. Home Mut. Ins. Co., 15 La. Ann. 217; Githens v.

(c) The instruction departed from and was not based on the pleaded cause of action. The instruction was based on the reply and not the petition. The law is well settled that recovery must be based on the cause of action pleaded in the petition. Mathieson v. Railroad, 219 Mo., l.c. 552-3, 118 S.W. 9; Hill v. Rich Hill Coal Mining Co., 119 Mo., l.c. 30, 24 S.W. 223; Rhodes v. Holliday, 105 Mo. App., l.c. 314, 79 S.W. 1145. (d) The instruction was erroneous in\nthat it ignored the defense of false and fraudulent misrepresentation on the part of the assured (plaintiff) after the loss and the defense that the assured, after discovering the peril, wrongfully and negligently failed to protect, save and salvage the insured property from loss. These were valid defenses. State ex rel. Arel v. Farringtion,  272 Mo. 157 ; Richards on the Law of Insurance (4 Ed.), Paragraph 237, page 370; Yellin v. National Security Co., 282 S.W. 520, l.c. 521 (Mo. App.); 6 Couch, Paragraph 1492, page 5350. An instruction for a verdict which ignores defenses pleaded and proven is reversible error. Pence v. Kansas City Laundry Service Co.,  332 Mo. 930 , 939-940; Luft v. Strobel,  322 Mo. 955 , 977-978; Austin v. Transit Co.,  115 Mo. App. 146 , 152; Jones v.

Southern,  210 Mo. App. 288 , 292; Tinkle v. Railway Co.,  212 Mo. 445 , 471. (3) The trial court erred in refusing defendant's requested instructions numbered 9, 10 and 11. Because in this case plaintiff was attempting to recover for collision loss and damage under a fire policy on the theory that fire in the tractor caused the collision of the trailer, the subject of the insurance, and the resulting collision damage; and, therefore, under plaintiff's theory and submission of the case the issue was whether fire was the proximate cause of the collision and loss. Each of these instructions was based on affirmative defenses pleaded in the amended answer and there was ample evidence in support of instruction No. 9. Under the pleadings and under the evidence the refusal of each of these instructions was reversible error. (4) The court erred in giving plaintiff's requested instruction No. 2 and in refusing defendant's requested instruction No. 6. Defendant had meritorious defenses to this case, and there was no basis for the assessment of penalties for alleged vexatious refusal to pay the loss. Non-Royalty Shoe Co. v. Insurance Co., 277 Mo. 399 , 420-423; Kusnetsky v. Insurance Companies, 313 Mo. 143 , 159; Weston v. Insurance Co.,  191 Mo. App. 282 , 285-286; State ex rel. Gott v.

(5) The court erred in refusing to sustain defendant's motion in arrest of judgment (156-7),\nbecause there was a complete departure in the reply from the petition (2-3, 14, 153-156). Judgment should have been rendered for defendant on the pleadings, because plaintiff abandoned the cause of action pleaded in his petition, and substituted the cause of action pleaded in his reply and the case was submitted to the jury on the cause of action pleaded in the reply by plaintiff's requested instruction No. 1. Mathieson v. Railroad, 219 Mo., l.c. 552-3, 118 S.W. 9; Hill v. Rich Hill Coal Mining Co., 119 Mo., l.c. 30, 24 S.W. 223; Rhodes v. Holladay, 105 Mo. App., l.c. 314, 79 S.W. 1145. (6) The court erred in admitting evidence of Delametter (plaintiff) and Jenkins, the driver, that the generator in the tractor, pulling the insured trailer, had caused trouble previous to the loss in question; and the court erred in overruling defendant's objection that such evidence was immaterial. Because the generator was not a part of the subject of the insurance. Such evidence was prejudicial and immaterial because there was no showing that the generator did or could cause a fire; and what caused the alleged fire was immaterial under the pleadings, and under the policy.\n\n Rosenberg  Brenner  and  Joseph Koralchik  for respondent.\n\n(1) The fire in the tractor was the proximate cause of the loss. (a) The proximate cause of a fire loss is the efficient cause and not the cause nearest in time to the result. Lanasa Fruit Steamship  I. Co. v. Universal Ins. Co., 58 Sup. Ct. 371; 6 Couch on Insurance, Sec. 1463, p. 5295; 6 Blashfield's Cyclopedia of Automobile Law, Sec. 3663, p. 190; Tracy v. Palmetto Fire Ins. Co. (Iowa),  222 N.W. 447 ; American Indemnity Co. v.

App. 315 , 70 S.W. 259. (b) The fire in the tractor was the efficient cause of the collision loss. Automotive Co. v. Fire Ins. Co.,  202 N.W. 32 . (c) The driver's negligence could only be a contingency against which the policy offered protection. 6 Couch, 5298; 26 C.J., Sec. 443, p. 347; Wertheimer-Swarts Shoe Co. v. U.S. Cas.

(2) The proximity of the tractor and trailer, as well as their interdependence, created a sufficient probability of loss in the event of fire in the tractor, as to make such fire the proximate cause of any ensuing damage to the trailer.
