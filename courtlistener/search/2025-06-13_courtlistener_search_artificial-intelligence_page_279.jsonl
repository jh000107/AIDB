(HEUISLER, J.)\n\nThe facts are stated in the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe following is Prayer No. 3 of the appellees, which the Court directed to be printed with the report of the case:\n\n City's Prayer No. 3 . &#8212; The jury are instructed that the measure of damages in this case is the market value of the property taken by the City of Baltimore, in this proceeding, at the time of the taking, considered without reference to the opening of Twenty-fifth street or any effect that such opening may have upon the property; and, in addition, such damage, if any, as may, by such opening, have been caused to the remaining property concerned. The fair market value of the property taken is the price that a purchaser willing but not compelled to buy would pay for it, and which a seller willing but not compelled to sell would accept for it.\n\nThey are further instructed that the measure of benefits is the increase in the market value of the property in controversy caused by the opening of Twenty-fifth street through the said property; and that this increase should be considered as the amount which a purchaser willing but not compelled to buy the property would pay for it, and which a seller willing but\nnot compelled to sell, will accept for it, after Twenty-fifth street shall have been opened, graded, paved and curbed; it being proper to take into account the fact that the property owner will be burdened when the street shall be paved, with the special paving tax of fifteen cents for each front foot on each side of said street for a period of ten years as a matter of law; and that, as a matter of fact, in order to utilize this property, it will be necessary for the property owner to pave the sidewalk and to grade the property back to a usable depth in connection with that street. ( Granted .)\n\nFor convenience of reference, the following prayers of the appellant, viz., the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 10th, and the City's Prayer No. 7 also, are inserted:\n\n Petitioners' 3rd Prayer . &#8212; In considering the value of the land taken, the jury must award the fair market value of the petitioners' land as between a seller willing but not anxious to sell and a purchaser ready but not obliged to buy, having regard to its highest utility &#8212; that is, the utility for which the jury may find it would command the highest price in the market. ( Refused .)\n\n Petitioners' 5th Prayer . &#8212; The jury are instructed that these proceedings are for the purpose of acquiring title from the petitioners, Laura Patterson and Sidney T. Dyer, and other land owners to a strip of land from Greenmount avenue to the Harford road as shown on the condemnation plat offered in evidence, to be used as a street, and are not proceedings for the grading, paving or curbing of the street; and the jury must not assess any benefits which they may find would be derived by the petitioners from the grading, paving or curbing of the street after title to the same has been acquired, but must confine themselves to such benefits, if any, as they may find would result directly to the petitioners from the acquisition of title to said land to be used as a street. ( Refused .)\n\n Petitioners' 6th Prayer . &#8212; This is not a proceeding for the grading or paving of Twenty-fifth street, and the jury must not include in their award of benefits, if any, any benefits\nwhich they may find the property of the petitioners, Laura Patterson and Sidney Turner Dyer, would derive from the grading or paving of Twenty-fifth street. ( Refused .)\n\n Petitioners' 10th Prayer . &#8212; The measure of benefits is the difference between what would be the actual market value of the land of the petitioners on which the benefits are sought to be assessed, at the present time, if Twenty-fifth street were not to be opened as projected in this proceeding, but if all other conditions remained as at present and the actual market value which said land will have after the title to the bed of Twenty-fifth street from Greenmount avenue to the Harford road has been acquired by the city under this proceeding to be used as a street, but before said Twenty-fifth street has been graded, curbed or paved.\n\nIf the jury, in arriving at their assessment of benefits, if any, consider the market value which the remaining property of the petitioners will have after Twenty-fifth street is graded, and after the said abutting property of the petitioners is graded so as to be beneficially usable in connection with Twenty-fifth street as so graded, they must deduct from that value the sum of the following items and treat only the balance as the amount to be assessed as benefits. The items to be so deducted are:\n\n(1) The cost of grading the street, including the sidewalk in front of the petitioners' property;\n\n(2) The cost of grading the abutting property of the petitioners so as to be beneficially usable in connection with the street as so graded; and,\n\n(3) The present market value of such abutting property of the petitioners at the present time on the assumption that Twenty-fifth street were not to be opened.\n\nIf the jury consider the value which the property will have after Twenty-fifth street is paved, they must deduct in addition to the items above mentioned the total cost of paving the street in front of the property of the petitioners, and assess as benefits only the balance, if any, remaining after making all of such deductions. ( Refused .)\n  City's Prayer No. 7 . &#8212; The jury are instructed that, in considering the benefits that will be conferred by the opening of Twenty-fifth street upon the property abutting on it, they are to consider all the street facilities which would fairly and reasonably be consequent upon the construction of the street.

A legislative act is presumed in law to be within the constitutional power of the body making it, whether that body be a municipal or a state legislative body.</p> <p>2. That presumption of validity of such legislative enactment cannot be overcome unless it appear that there is a clear conflict between the legislation in question and some particular provision or provisions of the constitution.</p> <p>3. Legislation, in order to be definite and certain, must either expressly, or by clear implication, classify the persons, .things, conditions and the like, upon which the law shall operate.</p> <p>4. Classification is an inherent right and power in legislation, limited only by the constitution and the judicial constructions thereunder.</p> <p>5. A classification must not be arbitrary, artificial, or evasive, but there must be a real and substantial distinction in the nature of the class or classes upon which the law operates.</p> <p>6. In respect to such distinctions, the legislative body has a wide discretion, and the legislation involving classification will not therefore be held invalid unless the classification attempted is clearly and obviously unreasonable to the point of discriminating against members of the same class, so as to deny them the equal protection of the laws.</p> <p>7. A classification of street obstructions into temporary and permanent, and providing that the ordinance shall operate only upon temporary obstructions, is a real and reasonable classification, and does not violate any provision of state or federal constitution.</p> <p>8.

{"absolute_url": "/opinion/3548296/evans-v-massman-construction-co/", "attorney": "Garrett  Ruark, Walter A. Raymond  and  Hume  Raymond  for appellant.\n\n(1) There is no liability on the contractor for doing this work unless it was not authorized by the United States engineers or was of such a nature that it could not be authorized by the United States engineers. (2) Everything appellant did in the construction of the dike in question was done under the orders and supervision of the United States engineers and under either the express specification of the contract or within the power to modify reserved to the United States engineers. Compagnie Du Pont De Rio Janeiro v. Mead Morris Mfg. Co.,  19 F.2d 163 ; United States v. Spearin,  248 U.S. 132 , 39 Sup. Ct. 59; Patten  Dumba v. Weightman,  51 Mo. 432 . (3) The subsequent acceptance of the Massman Construction Company's work, and the contracting officer's written approval thereof, constitutes a ratification of any modifications with reference to the use of a fender mat and the distance between the north end of the\ndike and the north bank. Crisp County v. Groves  Sons Co., 73 F.2d 327 , 96 A.L.R. 391; St. Louis v. Ruecking,  232 Mo. 325 , 134 S.W. 657; Aurora Water Co. v. Aurora,  129 Mo. 540 , 31 S.W. 946. (4) There was no duty on the defendant to protect the plaintiff from damages from overflow of his lands caused by work of the United States government in improving the Missouri River for navigation. Larson v. Met. St. Ry.,  110 Mo. 234 , 19 S.W. 416; Varas v. Stewart  Co.,  17 S.W.2d 651 ; Lambert v. Jones, 98 S.W.2d 752 . (a) Appellant erected the dike in question for the United States government as a part of government work in improving navigation on the Missouri River. The work was done under the immediate supervision and exactly as directed by the United States engineers. The defendant therefore is immune from suit on account of such work. (b) The court erred in holding the departmental order of the United States engineers requiring a channel of not less than 200 feet to be left at the north end of dike 314.1 created a duty on defendant owing to the plaintiff. (5) Appellant's employees were entirely under the direction and control of the United States engineers in all the details of the work and were the servants of the United States. Appellant is not liable for the acts of its servants while they were not subject to its control but were under the control of the United States. Larson v. Met. St. Ry. Co.,  110 Mo. 234 , 19 S.W. 417; Clayton v. Wells,  324 Mo. 1176 , 26 S.W.2d 973; Denton v. Yazoo  M.V. Ry. Co.,  284 U.S. 305 , 52 Sup. Ct. 141; Norfolk  W. Ry. Co. v. Hall, 57 F.2d 1007; Sun Oil Co. v. Dalzell Towing Co., 287 U.S. 291 , 53 Sup. Ct. 136; McLamb v. Du Pont De Nemours  Co., 79 F.2d 967. (6) Work on the dike had been suspended for some time before the overflow, the work had been approved, accepted and paid for except the portion held back until the completion of the entire contract. The United States engineers were in charge of the dike and appellant was not in control thereof at the time of the overflow and could not be liable therefor. Williams v. Gillen Dock Dredge  Const. Co., 258 F. 593; Savings Bank v. Ward, 100 U.S. 204 ; Erie  Western Transportation Co. v. Chicago, 178 F. 46; Ford v. Sturgis, 14 F.2d 254; Cummings v. Halpin, 27 S.W.2d 721.\n\n Henderson  Deacy  and  Prince  Beery  for respondent.\n\n(1) The negligent acts charged, to-wit, the use of a screen mat and the narrowness of the channel, were entirely beyond the scope of the contract between the defendant and the Federal government. The fact that the government's chief inspector &#8212; a young man of two and one-half years' experience (age 25) did not restrain defendant, affords no justification. (a) A contractual obligation which creates\na public duty, is actionable if violated. Lowry v. Kansas City, 337 Mo. 47 , 85 S.W.2d 111. (b) Negligence outside a public improvement contract is also actionable. Plater v. Mullins Const. Co.,  223 Mo. App. 650 , 17 S.W.2d 664. (c) Where the injury is collateral to the work contracted for, and entirely the result of the contractor's negligence, the latter alone is liable. Wilkey v. Rouse Const. Co.,  224 Mo. App. 495 , 28 S.W.2d 677; McGrath v. St. Louis,  215 Mo. 191 , 114 S.W. 618. (d) If the inspectors on this job gave orders beyond their authority, they would be joint tort-feasors, and liable with the contractor for the consequence. Neal v. Curtis,  328 Mo. 389 , 41 S.W.2d 546. (2) \"An independent contractor is a person who contracts with another to do something for him, but who is not controlled by the other nor subject to the other's right to control with respect to his physical conduct in the performance of the undertaking.\" In determining whether an independent contractural relation exists, the contract must be construed as a whole. The right to supervise on the part of the employer, to the end of accomplishing the stipulated results, without dictating the manner of work or physical conduct, does not detract from the relationship. Salmon v. Kansas City,  241 Mo. 14 , 145 S.W. 16; Gerber v. Kansas City, 304 Mo. 157 , 263 S.W. 440; Barnes v. Hosiery Mills Co., 108 S.W.2d 60; Skidmore v. Haggard,  110 S.W.2d 726 ; Kurik v. English,  340 Mo. 367 ,  100 S.W.2d 901 ; Coul v. Peck Dry Goods Co.,  326 Mo. 870 , 32 S.W.2d 759; Casement v. Brown, 148 U.S. 615 , 13 Sup. Ct. 675. (3) If a defendant's conduct is a substantial factor in bringing about harm to another, the fact that his negligence is not the sole cause, does not excuse him from liability, and the fact that he neither foresaw nor should have foreseen the extent of the harm, does not prevent him from being liable. Mrazek v. Term. Railroad Assn., 111 S.W.2d 30; St. Paul  Kansas City Railroad Co. v. U.S.F.  G. Co., 231 Mo. 613 , 105 S.W.2d 21; Car v. Supply Co.,  193 Mo. 562 , 239 S.W. 827; State ex rel. v. Haid,  333 Mo. 76 , 62 S.W.2d 402; Schneiter v. Chillicothe, 107 S.W. 1119; Christiensen v. St. Louis Pub. Serv. Co.,  333 Mo. 408 ; Williams v. St. L. Pub. Serv. Co.,  335 Mo. 335 ,  73 S.W.2d 199 . (a) If the plaintiffs shows that defendant has been guilty of acts which might reasonably be found to have been the cause of an accumulation of a dangerous element, and further shows that there was a condition existing which might cause said dangerous element to occasion danger to others, which defendant by the exercise of reasonable care might have known, there can be no question but that there is sufficient foundation upon which a jury could find a negligent cause, and this is so even though there is evidence from which the jury could also reasonably find that another cause occasioned\nthe damages.
