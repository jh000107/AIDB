Against mis-statements which concern the essence or subject matter of the contract, equity will relieve, whether they be the result of fraud or mistake. But against such as concern merely the value of the property sold, equity will not relieve, so far as to rescind a sale already executed.</p> <p>With reference to the effect of fraudulent misrepresentations by a vendor touching the property sold, there is a material distinction in a court of equity, whether the bill is for the specific performance of a contract yet unexecuted, or it is a bill to rescind a contract which has been executed. \u00a7 It is in this last class of cases that courts of equity so stringently apply the maxim caveat cmptor, a hard, stern maxim, but one founded both on justice and policy.</p> <p>Although for mere inadequacy of consideration, without other circumstances, a contract executed will not be rescinded, yet an unconscionable bargain made with a person of such weak understanding as to be incapable of self-protection, though not an idiot or lunatic, raises a presumption that it was procured through some fraud, or undue influence; and on this ground, equity will relieve such a person against a transaction which it would not, if it had been made with one of ordinary capacity. However, the court interferes in this class of cases with great caution, and only where the mental weakness to such a degree as disables the party for self-protection is clearly made out in the proof.</p> <p>In all the cases in which the question of fraud, undue influence, or incapacity is raised, inadequacy of consideration is a material element; that is, by it proof on these points,which otherwise would be doubtful, may be rendered decisive. In a case where the capacity of a party to bargain is left in doubt, the very exorbitancy of the bargain may convince the court that the party must have been unfit to transact business, and have become the dupe of some imposition. But to have this effect, the inadequacy must be gross, and such as to shock the conscience and confound the judgment of any man of common sense. In all the cases in which inadequacy of price or value, has been treated as a material consideration, it has been of this gross character ; and the inequality has not been less than half the value.</p>"}
