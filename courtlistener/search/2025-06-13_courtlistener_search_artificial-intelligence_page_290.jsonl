The land was what is known as \u201csage brush and alkali land\u201d in a rough mountainous country, and practically worthless for agricultural or grazing purposes. It lay on the western slope of a ridge, and.in the valley adjoining and on the slope of such ridge, within a quarter of a mile of the nearest point of the land, was a well-known outcrop of veins of coal of high commercial grade, many miles in length north and south: the largest; vein being from 6 to 14 feet in thickness, and all dipping to the westward. Defendant and another company were operating mines in such veins in the valley to the northward of these lands and a third company to the south of them, its workings extending to the line of one of the tracts, whore they stopped in a vein 10 feet or more in thickness. The lands had for many years been regarded by general reputation as coal lands, and the year before one of the entrymen, who was manager of defendant\u2019s mines, had filed a declaratory coal statement on one of the tracks which he afterward abandoned; also at about the time of the entries defendant purchased a tract within half a mile of some of the entries which had been purchased as coal land from the government at Sp20 per aere, and liad thereon an eight-foot vein.
