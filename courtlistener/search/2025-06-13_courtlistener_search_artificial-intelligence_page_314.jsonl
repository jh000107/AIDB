Sec. 10479, R.S. 1919. (2) In determining the reasonableness of rates, no better test can ordinarily be found than the rates customarily charged in localities similarly situated. State ex rel.

(4) Reasonable rates cannot be predicated upon excessive or abnormal operating expenses. Knoxville v. Knoxville Water Co.,  212 U.S. 1 , 53 L.Ed. 371; Darnell v.

(5) An honest and intelligent forecast of probable future income or net earnings is essential in fixing fair and reasonable rates. Galveston Elec. Co. v. Galveston,  258 U.S. 388 , 66 L.Ed. 678; Georgia Ry. \nPower Co. v. Railroad Commission, P.U.R. 1925A, 546. (6) No separate or specific allowance for going value need be included in the valuation\nof a public utility's property when it has been valued as a successful, functioning, co-ordinated plant, and not as so much unused or unrelated property, and when there has been included in the value substantial allowances for organization, interest, engineering, taxes and general expenses during construction, because all these items enter into the development of the utility's property, and give it an added value not represented in the valuation of the mere physical property; and this is particularly so when there are no definite, concrete facts upon which to base such allowance.

(7) Property not used and useful in rendering service should be excluded from the rate base. 2 Whitten, Valuation of Public Service Corps., sec. 461, pp. 809-811. (8) In ascertaining fair present value as of a certain date, proper consideration must be given to any changes in reproduction costs, as used in a prior valuation. McCardle v. Indianapolis Water Co.,  272 U.S. 400 , 71 L.Ed. 316, 47 Sup. Ct. Rep. 144; R.S. 1919, sec. 10487, sub-sec. 2. (9) All income obtained by the investment in plant or otherwise of money in the depreciation reserve account should be credited to and carried in said account. R.S. 1919, sec. 10488. (10) The failure of the company to provide in the past for depreciation as it accrued does not justify an increased allowance to offset this plain failure of the management to preserve the integrity of its investment; and this is true whether such failure is the result of paying unwarranted dividends in the past, or because sufficient rates were not charged for the service rendered. Past losses, if any, cannot be used to support a claim that rates for the future are inadequate or confiscatory. Knoxville v. Knoxville Water Co.,  212 U.S. 1 , 29 Sup. Ct.

Util. Comrs. v. New York Tel. Co.,  271 U.S. 23 . (11) In order to determine the proper annual depreciation allowance, full consideration must be given to the entire history of past depreciation, the past expense for replacement, the past operating expenses, including maintenance;\nthe character and probable life of the property, the method adopted in the past to preserve the property, and the amount accumulated in the depreciation reserve.
