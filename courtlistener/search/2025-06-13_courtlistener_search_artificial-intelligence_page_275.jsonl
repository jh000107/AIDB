Otis, \nAssistant Attorney-General, for informant;  Sam B. Jeffries,  Carter, Collins  Jones, H.R. Small, Foristel  of counsel.\n\nThe information states a cause of action. The information charges that respondent, without national or state authority, and in violation of national and state law, has established and is operating a branch bank at St. Louis, Missouri, and proposes to establish and operate numerous other branch banks in St. Louis, Missouri. (a) It is outside the authority of and against the law for a national or a state bank to establish or operate branch banks in Missouri. National Bank Act provisions: U.S.R.S., sec. 5134 (U.S. Comp. Stat. 1916, sec. 9659; U.S.R.S., sec. 5155 (U.S. Comp. Stat. 1916, sec. 9695); Act of Congress, May 1, 1886, c. 73, sec. 2, 24 Stat. 18 (U.S. Comp. Stat. 1916, sec. 9662); U.S.R.S., sec. 5190 (U.S. Comp. Stat. 1916, sec. 9744); Act of Congress, Dec. 23, 1913, c. 6, sec. 25, as amended, Act of Congress, Sept. 7, 1916, c. 461 (U.S. Comp. Stat. 1916, sec. 9745). Special branch bank authorizations by Congress: For branch of a national bank at the Chicago Exposition, Act of Congress, May 12, 1892; for branch bank at Louisiana Purchase Exposition at St. Louis, Act of Congress March 3, 1901. Rulings and authorities: First National Bank v. Hawkins,  174 U.S. 364 , 369; Opinion of Attorney-General of the United States in case of Lowry National Bank of Atlanta, Ga., vol. 29, page 81; Magee on Banks and Banking (2 Ed. 1913) pp. 42-45; Pratt's Digest of Federal Banking Laws (1920 Ed.) p. 100; Ruling of Comptroller of the Currency that national banks have no right to establish or operate branch banks in Missouri 1922; First National Bank of Elizabethtown v. Commonwealth of Kentucky, 34 L.R.A. (N.S.) 54. Missouri Statutes provisions: Sec. 11737, subdiv. 1, and Sec. 11684, R.S. 1919. (b) Courts recognize the construction placed upon statutes by officers whose duty it is to execute them, especially when such construction has been made by the highest officers in the executive department of the government and have been\nfollowed for many years, when, too, such construction is reasonable and of great persuasive force. Ewing v. Vernon County, 216 Mo. 681 ; United States v. Finnell,  185 U.S. 236 ; Sedalia v. Smith,  206 Mo. 364 ; Construction Co. v. Ice Rink Co., 242 Mo. 262 ; State ex rel. v. Cupples  283 Mo. 115 . (c) The course of conduct of national banks relative to branches, the attitude of the Congress relative thereto, and the rulings and attitude of the United States Treasury Department, have fixed a positive policy of limitation against branch banking by national banks in the United States since 1864, and the courts will recognize such long-established banking practice and legislative, executive and general policies, and will adopt such construction of the statutes, there being nothing in conflict with such construction. 36 Cyc. 1140-1142; Krohn v. Kansas City Home Telephone Co., 131 Mo. App. 313 ; McChesney v. Hager, 104 S.W. 714; Ewing v. Vernon County,  216 Mo. 689 ; Corsicana Natl. Bank v. Johnson, 251 U.S. 83 . (d) The national public policy and Missouri public policy on branch banking in Missouri are one and the same. There is no conflict of policies involved in this case. Missouri is simply seeking to suppress illegal, unauthorized acts of respondent that are opposed to the policy of both state and nation. Gilbert v. Minnesota,  254 U.S. 325 , 329; Halter v. Nebraska,  205 U.S. 34 ; Hale v. Henkle,  201 U.S. 43 . (e) The same act may be a transgression against both the Federal and State governments and each may punish or suppress without a conflict between their respective sovereignties. Gilbert v. Minnesota,  254 U.S. 325 , 332; Hale v. Henkel,  201 U.S. 43 . (f) While a suit may not be brought (because of the Eleventh Amendment to the Federal Constitution) against a state or the officials of a state, acting under and in pursuance of lawful authority, suit may be brought against state officials, even by individuals, to keep them from enforcing unconstitutional or illegal enactments, for the reason that such enactments are nullities and, therefore, such officials cannot be acting as such in attempting to enforce them.\nLikewise, operations of a national bank organization that are outside the field of authorized national bank operations and so are, in fact, not national bank operations, can be challenged by the state in which such operations take place. And if, besides being unauthorized by and in violation of national authority, such operations are also opposed to state law governing banks and are against the public policy of the state, such outlaw operations may properly be suppressed by the state. Ex parte Young,  209 U.S. 123 , 159; Merchants Exchange v. Knott, 212 Mo. 616 , 647, 648; Carson v. Sullivan, 223 S.W. (Mo.) 571; First Natl. Bank v. Kentucky, 34 L.R.A. (N.S.) 54; Sec. 11684, R.S. 1919.\n\n Jones, Hocker, Sullivan  Angert  for respondent.\n\n(1) The temporary injunction issued in aid of the writ of  quo  warranto  was invalid and contrary to the Federal statute. U.S. Compld. Stat., sec. 9834; Pacific Natl. Bank v. Mixer, 124 U.S. 721 ; Van Reed v. People's Natl. Bank,  198 U.S. 554 ; 3 R.C.L. sec. 323, p. 691; 7 C.J. sec. 803, p. 838; Freeman Mfg. Co. v. Natl. Bank  160 Mass. 398 ; Meyer v. First Natl. Bank, 10 Ida. 175; Hazen v. Natl. Bank,  70 Vt. 543 ; Dennis v. First Natl. Bank, 127 Cal. 453 ; Chesapeake Bank v. First Natl. Bank,  40 Md. 269 . (2) The State has no power to complain. A national bank is the creature of national sovereignty, and amenable to and controllable by it and no other, and an information in  quo warranto  against a corporation lies only at the instance and in the name of the sovereign power which created it. State ex rel. v. Curtis, 35 Conn. 374 ; State ex rel. Parker v. Bowen,  8 S.C. 400 ; McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 429; Ableman v. Booth, 21 How. 516; Territory v. Lockwood, 3 Wall. 238; McClung v.

Bank v. Union Trust Co.,  244 U.S. 427 . (3) A national bank is given authority to\ntransact such a banking business as is specified in the act of Congress, and all incidental powers necessary to carry on that business are granted. 13 U.S. Stat. sec. 5136; First Natl. Bank v. National Exchange,  92 U.S. 127 ; Western Natl. Bank v. Armstrong,  152 U.S. 351 ; Bullard v. Bank, 18 Wall. 593; Logan County Natl. Bank v. Townsend,  139 U.S. 73 ; Shoemaker v. Natl.

Meservey  and  James E.  Goodrich, amici curiae,  on motion for rehearing.\n\n(1) From a careful reading of the various opinions in these cases we feel that the question causing the greatest diversity of opinion is this: Do the restrictions imposed by the ordinance constitute a taking of property without compensation? In an orderly consideration of the foregoing question we should first determine exactly what is embraced within the term \"properly,\" as the word is used in its constitutional sense. In conformity with the past rulings of this court, we believe that all will agree upon the following fundamental propositions: (a) By the term property is meant, not the tangible, physical thing, but the right to use or exercise dominion over the thing. 22 R.C.L. 37; St. Louis v. Hill,  116 Mo. 533 . (b) That this right to use or exercise dominion over the thing is limited to those uses and those acts of dominion which are not injurious to others or to the community. 22 R.C.L. 39. From the two foregoing propositions, which are so elemental that we will not at this time burden the court with citation of other authorities, it necessarily follows: (c) That \"property,\" as used in the Constitution, does not include those uses or acts of dominion which are injurious to others or to the community. And since those uses and acts of dominion which are injurious to others or to the community are\nnot property, and are not property rights, it also necessarily follows: (d) That a police regulation, restraining or restricting those uses or acts of dominion which are injurious to others or to the community, does not constitute a taking of property within its constitutional meaning. 22 R.C.L. 40, 41. (2) Under numerous decisions heretofore cited in those cases, it may be conceded that by the words \"injurous to others or to the community\" is meant those uses and acts of dominion which are injurious or detrimental to the public health, safety, morals, comfort, convenience, prosperity or general welfare. We believe that it will stand admitted by all: (a) That the natural tendency of an invasion of a quiet, clean district of residences (whether it be a district of mansions or cottages) by apartments, hotels, retail stores or factories, is to bring about a marked depression of property values in such district; that the natural tendency of such invasion is to destroy the comfort, quiet, cleanliness and restfulness of such district; that the natural tendency of such invasion is to cause an exodus of the home owners of such district, followed by a condition of landlordism and tenantry resulting generally in a neglected, run-down district with original values practically wiped out; and that the natural tendency of such an invasion (varying in degree with the character and extent of the invasion) is toward the destruction of the healthful, wholesome, moral surroundings which should safeguard home and family life, and the rearing of children. It is a matter of common knowledge that practically all the large cities of the country contain large areas of blighted district where business and industry have invaded residence districts which were naturally suited for residence purposes, and not for business or industrial purposes. As a result, these districts are now ruined for residence purposes, and practically unused for business and industry. (b) It is a matter of common knowledge that this shifting of uses and districts has cost the public millions of dollars in\nuseless expenses in rearranging public improvements and public utility service to take care of demands that would have been avoided by a stabilization of uses and use districts. (c) Zoning laws do not tend to destroy this economic and natural development; on the contrary, their purpose is to secure and stabilize such development, and at the same time give protection to the beneficial uses of property, and the general welfare of the community. (d) The question of cheap transportation is one of the most serious problems confronting large cities. Such large areas of near in property have been invaded by scattered business and industrial uses that a general exodus of home owners to the far out districts has resulted. (3) All will concede that an invasion of a residence district by apartments, hotels, business and industry is, as a matter of plain fact and common knowledge, usually and naturally attended by all or some of the evils pointed out above. If such concession be made, then follows the final proposition, as follows: Are these evils such evils as are detrimental to the public health, safety, morals, comfort, convenience, prosperity or general welfare? The answer to this proposition is so plain that the question almost answers itself. Who will contend that crowded traffic laden streets, contaminated atmosphere, increased fire hazards, decreased efficiency of fire fighting apparatus, overtaxed water mains, overtaxed sewers, increased dirt, smoke and germ laden dust, and the erection of huge buildings cutting off light and air is not detrimental to the health and safety of all persons, and particularly to the children and the old and infirm living in a district so affected? (4) From a consideration of all the indispensable facts and legal principles heretofore discussed, the general summing up must be as follows: (a) Our Constitution prohibits the taking of private property without compensation. (b) \"Property\" as used in the constitutional prohibition is not the physical thing, but is the right to make such uses and to exercise such acts of dominion over the thing as are not\ndetrimental to the public health, safety, morals, comfort, convenience, prosperity or general welfare. (c) The invasion of a residence district by apartments, hotels, business places and factories is, in its natural tendency, an evil which is detrimental to the public health, safety, morals, comfort, convenience, prosperity and general welfare. (d) It therefore follows that the act of the State in remedying this evil by restricting and restraining those uses and acts of dominion which are detrimental to the public health, safety, morals, comfort, convenience, properity and general welfare, does not amount to a taking of property. Hibbard v. Halliday,  158 P. 1158 , L.R.A. 1916F, 903. (5) None of the courts which uphold the validity of zoning laws have done so upon the theory that the evils sought to be remedied are public nuisances. On the contrary, as in the case of Des Moines v. Manhattan Oil Co., 184 N.W. 823, the court enters an express disclaimer of resting its decision upon the ground of nuisance.", "caseName": "State Ex Rel. Penrose Investment Co. v.

Gayle v. Car  Fdry. Co., 177 Mo. 427 ; Kipp v. Oyster,  133 Mo. App. 711 ; Long v. Moon,  107 Mo. 334 ; Mallory v. Pure Ice Co., 6 S.W.2d 623. (3) Even on plaintiff's testimony the supervision by the brick company of the elements of getting the clay, where to dump the clay and where to drive in the shed in order to dump the clay did not constitute plaintiff a servant of the brick company. Fink v. Furnace Co.,  82 Mo. 276 ; Kiser v. Suppe,  133 Mo. App. 19 ; Casement v. Brown,  148 U.S. 615 ; Salmon v. Kansas City,  241 Mo. 14 ; Gerber v. Kansas City, 263 S.W. 432 ; McGrath v.

(7) The court having permitted a disclosure that there was liability insurance in the case, should have permitted appellant to disclose it carried no liability insurance.\n\n N. Murry Edwards  for respondent.\n\n(1) Plaintiff was a servant of the brick company in the hauling of clay at its plant where he was injured. The evidence showed that the company in its written contract with Wells reserved the right of control by designating the number and kind of teams and drivers, fixing the rate of wages to be paid them and reserving the right to designate the place where and time when they should work and by actually supervising and controlling the work with respect to the manner in which the details were performed. Lawhon v. Veterinary Laboratories (Mo.), 252 S.W. 48; Diehl v. Fire Brick Co.,  299 Mo. 641 ; Porter v. Estate Co.,  201 Mo. App. 27 ; Aubuchon v. Const. Co. (Mo. App.), 291 S.W. 189; Simmons v. Murray,  234 S.W. 1009 . (a) Although plaintiff received his wages from Wells he was a servant of the company because that company had the right to and did control and direct him in his work. Holloway v. Schield,  294 Mo. 512 ; Karguth v. Coal  Coke Co., 299 Mo. 580 . (b) As the evidence showed that plaintiff was subject to the direction and control of defendant company in the manner, method and means in which he did the work required, the court did not err in refusing to declare as a matter of law that the brick company was an independent contractor. Hoelker v. Am. Press Co. (Mo.), 296 S.W. 1011; Lawhon v. Veterinary Laboratories (Mo.), 252 S.W. 48. (2) Plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law because the evidence showed that he could not see the condition into which he was moving and did not know how close the clay was to the cross-beams ahead of him as he drove north just before he was injured. The danger was not so glaring as to warrant an ordinarily careful and prudent person of plaintiff's age and experience to refuse to obey the order of his superior, to drive through the clay shed where he was injured. Ingram v. Coal Co. (Mo.) 5 S.W.2d 415; Brann v. Brick Co. (Mo. App.), 288 S.W. 943; Schlavick v. Shoe Co. (Mo. App.), 137 S.W. 81. The evidence showed that plaintiff was ordered to drive through the\nshed at the place where he was injured, by the company's superintendent. Therefore, plaintiff had a right to assume that he could drive through said place with safety, and was not guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law in obeying said order. McCarver v. Lead Co.,  216 Mo. App. 370 ; Rutledge v. Swinney,  170 Mo. App. 251 ; Clayton v. Metalscrafts Corp. (Mo. App.), 12 S.W.2d 940; Gale v. Mill Co.,  159 Mo. App. 653 . (3) Instructions 1 and 3 are within both the scope of the pleadings and the evidence, and, therefore, proper. (a) Instruction 13 correctly stated the law. Diehl v. Fire Brick Co.,  299 Mo. 641 ; Porter v. Withers Estate,  201 Mo. App. 27 ; Lawhon v. Veterinary Lab., 252 S.W. 44. (b) If Instruction 5 is in conflict with Instruction 13, which is correct, then Instruction 5 is erroneous and the court did not err in giving said Instruction 13. Moran v. Rys. Co. (Mo. App.), 232 S.W. 1113, Turner v. Morris, 142 Mo. App. 60 ; Shubart v. Mines etc. Co.,  143 Mo. App. 574 ; Sparks v. Harvey, 214 S.W. 251. (4) The judgment of $16,000 is not excessive. The evidence showed plaintiff was seventeen years old at the time he suffered a fracture of the third lumbar vertebra, underwent an operation in which a piece of bone was removed from his shin and implanted in his back, spent eight months in the hospital and during most of the time was compelled to lie in a rigid position. Since leaving the hospital he has had to wear braces around his body. Three lumbar vertebrae joints are locked and his back is permanently stiff and weak, and he will never be able to do manual labor. His pain and suffering have been and will be severe and continuous. (5) The court did not err in refusing to permit the company to disclose to the jury that it carried no liability insurance on the showing, out of the hearing of the jury, that Wells carried insurance. Smith v. Cab Co. (Mo.),  19 S.W.2d 467 ; Malone v. Small (Mo. App.), 291 S.W. 163; Foulks v. Lehman, 17 S.W.2d 994; Maurizi v. Coal  Mining Co. (Mo.), 11 S.W.2d 275. (6) There was evidence tending to prove that the light where plaintiff was injured was insufficient; therefore, the court erred in refusing to give instruction lettered F offered by the plaintiff, which submitted to the jury the question of whether defendant Wells had furnished plaintiff with reasonably sufficient light to do the work required of him. Eaton v. Wallace (Mo.), 287 S.W. 616; Oakley v. Richards,  275 Mo. 266 ; Arnold v. Graham,  219 Mo. App. 249 ; Wendler v. House Furnishing Co.,  165 Mo. 527 ; Carney v. Brewing Assn.,  150 Mo. App. 437 ; Yost v. Cement Co.,  191 Mo. App. 422 . (7) The general instruction numbered 2 given by the court on behalf of plaintiff submitting the assignment of negligence against defendant Wells as to his failure to furnish a safe place to work, although it required the jury to find as one of the elements of an unsafe place that there was not sufficient\nlight, did not deprive the plaintiff of the right to have his case submitted under Instruction F on the sole ground of light as to defendant Wells, because the jury might have returned a verdict against defendant Wells under Instruction F while finding for him under general Instruction 2. Northam v. Rys. Co. (Mo.), 176 S.W. 227; Evans v. Klusmeyer,  301 Mo. 352 .\n\n Jones, Hocker, Sullivan  Angert  and  Robert L. Aronson  for respondent, Wells.\n\n(1) The refusal of the trial court to give appellant's Instruction F was not prejudicial error. (a) The matter contained therein was embodied in Instruction No. 2, which had been given, and it is not reversible error to refuse an instruction covered by others. Leighton v. Davis, 260 S.W. 986; Flenner v. Southwest Mo. R. Co.,  290 S.W. 78 ; Rock v. Keller,  312 Mo. 458 ; Metropolitan Paving Co. v. Investment Co.,  309 Mo. 638 . (b) Respondent's mastership and control over appellant had been relinquished temporarily while the latter was performing the work of a third person. Consequently, respondent was not bound to provide sufficient light for the work of appellant and the instruction was improper. Hardy v. Shedden Co., 78 F. 610, 24 C.C.A. 261, 37 L.R.A. 33; Winkleblack v. Mining Co., 187 S.W. 95; Simmons v. Murray,  234 S.W. 1009 ; Grothmann v. Hermann, 241 S.W. 461; Healy v. Stove Co.,  161 Mo. App. 483 . (c) Instruction F was improper under the rule that a master is not bound to provide a safe working place or proper light when the service is performed on premises belonging to and controlled by a third person. Channon v. Sanford Co.,  70 Conn. 573 , 41 L.R.A. 200; Roche v. Ironworks Co.,  140 Cal. 563 ; Wilson v. Improvement Co., 69 W. Va. 778 , 45 L.R.A. (N.S.) 271; Lochring v. Const. Co., 118 Mo. App. 163 ; Lofty v. Const. Co.,  256 S.W. 83 ; Powell v. Walker, 195 Mo. App. 150 . (2) Since respondent's demurrer to the evidence should have been sustained by the trial court, all instructions offered by respondent are immaterial. Phillips v. Pub. Co., 238 S.W. 127; Koehler v.
