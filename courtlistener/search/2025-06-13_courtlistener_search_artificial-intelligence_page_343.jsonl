Reversed.Suit by the State of South Carolina, on the relation of John M. Daniel, Attorney General, against J.H. Strong and others, as executors of and trustees under the will of\nJohn K. Crosswell, deceased, and others. Decree for complaint, and defendants appeal.\n\nThe report of the master (H.C. Haynsworth) is as follows:\n\nThis case was referred to me by order of his Honor, Judge P.H. Stoll, to take the testimony and report the same together with my conclusions both of law and of fact.\n\nThe late John K. Crosswell, of this city and county, died May 30, 1929, leaving of force his last will and testament dated October 15, 1915, to which was appended a codicil dated February 18, 1928, both of which were admitted to probate June 4, 1929, in common form.\n\nIn the will, C.B. Yeadon, J.H. Strong, and the Sumter Trust Company were named as executors and trustees. When the trust company closed its doors, the codicil was added substituting R.R. Bruner in its stead. In no other wise was the will changed.\n\nThese three duly qualified under the will and entered upon the performance of their duties as directed therein.\n\nThe will makes certain bequests, which are small in comparison with size of the estate. Since these are not in dispute, they have no bearing on the issue herein and are not before the Court, except as reference may be made to them for light on the meaning of the words \"executor\" or \"trustee.\"\n\nThe bulk of this handsome estate was given to establish an orphanage, as set out in Paragraph X of the will.\n\nThis cause arises from an inquiry by the State of South Carolina, through the Attorney General, into the acts and doings of these executors and trustees in view of the provisions of Paragraphs VIII, X, and XI of the will. The authority for this inquiry was duly certified on the complaint by the honorable, the Attorney General of this State, as its legal representative.\n\nIn pursuance of the directions in said will, the executors and trustees selected J.H. Strong to represent the Crosswell estate at stockholders' meeting in Columbia on the . . . .\nday of . . . . . . . ., 1929. The result of this meeting was the election of Mrs. Lumpkin as president, Mr. Strong as vice-president and treasurer, and Mr. Bruner as secretary and general manager. The salaries were fixed at $9,000.00 for Mrs. Lumpkin; $7,800.00 for Mr. Bruner. No salary was provided for Mr. Strong.\n\nIt seems from Mr. Bruner's testimony (page 415) that the matter of reduction of salaries had been discussed with Mrs. Lumpkin. \"She intimated to me that she was not going to allow her salary to be reduced\" (page 417). \"I gave the executors this information.\"\n\nOn August 9, 1929, the executors petitioned and obtained an order from the Probate Court authorizing them to sell the personal property of the estate, including some of the stocks, at not less than the appraised value. The petition stated their intention to sell some of the stocks and to retain others, but there were no specifications of the particular stocks to be sold.\n\nMeantime, the Probate Court had appointed as appraisers of the assets of the estate, Messrs. J.J. Riley, S.L. Roddey, and Earle Rowland. It is admitted, and I so find, that no better appraisers could have been selected.\n\nThese three gentlemen testified in detail to the pains they took in arriving at the values shown in their appraisal. They were especially careful to set out in a written memorandum, which is an exhibit in this case, their method of determining the value of the twenty-five shares in the corporation of H.D. and J.K. Crosswell. Letters were written; a trip was made to Columbia to examine the books and records of the company; other business men were consulted. Several methods of arriving at a proper value were discussed. Altogether, this board gave about three months to this important task. The appraisers all stated that they had tried to determine the actual value on a conservative basis and had not attempted to find as low a value as possible for inheritance tax purposes.\n\nThey took the figures from the books for five years, 1924 to 1928, inclusive, and averaged them. From the total income they deducted the operating expenses. Then, in view of the request in the will that the salaries be reduced, they next deducted $2,500.00 for the salary account instead of the $20,500.00 which had been paid up to Mr. Crosswell's death. This appears to have been arrived at by taking the difference between the salary of Mr. Crosswell, who was in active charge of the business, and that of Mrs. Lumpkin, who took her profits in the form of salary to the extent that the Internal Revenue Bureau would allow. This made a difference of $18,000.00 between the net income as shown by the books and the net income considered by the appraisers; that is to say, the net book income was increased by $18,000.00 for purposes of appraisal. The average net income arrived at by this method was $35,824.00. They then decided that a stock of this character was entitled to a 7 per cent. income, and that the total value of all the stock would on this basis be $511,770.00 Dividing this by two, they fixed the value of the Crosswell interest at $255,885.00.\n\nWhile this board of appraisers was still in the discharge of its duties, the great panic occurred; its effect being world-wide.\n\nMr. Strong came back from the meeting in Columbia convinced that this stock should be sold. The evidence shows that Mr. Yeadon at first demurred, being reluctant to appear to disregard the expressed wish of the testator. Mr. Bruner seems to have adopted a rather neutral attitude, taking little part in the discussions, except to communicate Mrs. Lumpkin's position on the salary question, namely, that she declined to consider any reduction.\n\nThese three met very frequently during this period. Finally, Mr. Yeadon was brought over to Mr. Strong's view and Mr. Bruner made it unanimous. Having reached this conclusion, the executors and trustees set about making the best sale possible. They felt themselves bound by the order\nof the Probate Court and the return of the appraisers. At the suggestion of Mr. Bruner, the board got into communication with Mr. Crawford Johnson, of Birmingham, Ala., one of the largest operators of Coca-Cola plants in the South. Mr. Johnson states that he was especially interested in this contract because he holds the subbottling contract thereunder for Spartanburg, Laurens, Darlington, and Hartsville, though most of his plants are in the Mississippi Valley.\n\nIn December, 1929, Mr. Johnson came to Sumter, and discussed the matter with the representatives of the Crosswell estate. When Mr. Johnson learned that no price less than the value fixed by the appraisers would or could be considered, he declined to do more than say that he would buy at $200,000.00 for half interest in the first-line bottling contract and $25,000.00 for certain subbottling contracts which are still held by the estate as sole owners, Mrs. Lumpkin having no interest in these. They are therefore not in issue in this cause. At the request of one or more of the board, he put this decision into writing in the form of a letter.\n\nUpon the receipt of this letter, the Crosswell estate then made a formal offer of this one-half interest to Mrs. Lumpkin at the appraised price, which was accepted and the sale was closed under the supervision of George D. Levy, Esq., one of the attorneys for the executors and trustees.\n\nIn making this assignment only the title \"executors\" was written after the names of the three signers. The attorneys for the State made the issue by amendment that the power of sale was given to the trustees and not to the executors under the will, whereupon counsel for the respondents had Messrs. Yeadon, Strong, and Bruner add the word \"trustees\" to said assignment on each certificate of stock. This was done at the last reference just before the arguments began. The three signers stated that the title \"trustees\" was omitted through inadvertence, and that they desired to correct this when called to their attention.\n\nThe executors and trustees then invested the proceeds of this sale, as well as other funds coming into their hands, in securities, principally long-term bonds which have been giving an average yield of 4 1/4 per cent. They state that they have now increased the corpus of the estate by $84,000.00.\n\nThey further show that a convenient tract of land was bought on the northern edge of the City of Sumter; that they named two discreet persons to act with them as trustees, namely, C.G. Rowland and J.J. Riley; that two units of the orphanage were built according to the most approved plans which they decided upon after a thorough investigation of such plants in North and South Carolina; that the same were approved by the Duke Endowment Foundation; that they secured an expert superintendent in the person of Dr. T.A. Quattlebaum, and that children are being given an excellent home and proper training in the institution; that they have given a great deal of time and thought to this sacred trust, with a high sense of their responsibility and are conscious of no delict in the performance of their duties.\n\nAt the first reference, it was agreed that Mr. C.T. Hagen, of the auditing firm of Respass  Respass, be allowed time to examine the books of the corporations. He submitted a full resume of the financial history of the enterprise, which is in evidence available for reference.\n\n                         FINDINGS OF FACT \nIt is impractical to separate entirely the facts and law of this case, but I shall attempt to do so far as possible.\n\nSince the chancellor hearing this case may take a different view from that reached by the Master, it is my purpose to submit all of the facts, including those that had little weight with me.\n\nOf course, (1) the plea in bar, and (2) the right to sell, come at the beginning of the case, since if the first is sustained, there is nothing further to be said; if the second is\ndenied, the sale must be set aside, and all other matters in the voluminous transcript of the testimony are of no moment. But these are matters of law, and my findings thereon will be deferred to the latter part of the report.\n\nI. In the first place, I can discover no facts in the testimony to sustain the charge of gross negligence, save in the one matter of securing an offer for the half interest in question.\n\nThe State contends that the sale was not advertised; that no offer was received; that the conference with Mr. Crawford Johnson resulted, not in an offer, but in the refusal to make an offer.\n\nTo this the executors and trustees reply that they considered a Coca-Cola dealer as the only likely purchaser of so valuable an enterprise; that they consulted with Mr. Rainwater, of the parent company in Atlanta, and by his advice opened negotiations with the most likely purchaser in the South, a man who might have a special interest in purchasing because he held the Spartanburg, Darlington, Hartsville and Laurens subbottling contracts; that discussions with him convinced them that no outside purchaser would better his tenative offer of $200,000.00 in view of the fact that only a half interest was for sale. To sustain this contention, several men representing large Coca-Cola plants in North and South Carolina were put upon the stand; each testified that he would not have bettered Mr. Johnson's figures, and that the price obtained was not only adequate, but was higher than they would have thought of giving.\n\nOn the other hand, the State produced no one who would have been willing to better these figures, relying on the auditor's report to show that the franchise was actually worth more than the price paid and, in addition, was a growing business, which should have been retained in view of the provisions of the will. The question as to disregarding the will comes under another head.\n\nIf there was any other instance of negligence, it has not been called to my attention.\n\nI therefore find that, if there was any negligence at all, it was not so gross as to amount to fraud; and that the three trustees honestly and sincerely believed that no one other than Mrs. Lumpkin would give as much as the appraised price. Mr. Bruner was asked why, if the price was so high, he, as Mrs. Lumpkin's adviser in business matters, allowed her to pay so much. His reply was that he advised her against the purchase, but that she was anxious to buy this half interest anyway; that she did not like to have to deal with five trustees.\n\n                      II. REASONS FOR SELLING \nTo show that the sale was not an arbitrary exercise of the power to sell, but that the point had been reached where, in their judgment, it was to the manifest advantage of the estate to sell the stock in question. These may be summarized under eight heads &#8212; for the benefit of the hard-pressed Judge, who cannot possibly give the time to any case that the Master must give, I make a finding on each reason:\n\n1.  That there were no physical assets  &#8212;  only a scrap of  paper.  This,  in my judgment , is not a sound reason. A franchise such as this has a value not realized or appreciated in this section of the country. There are multitudes of instances &#8212; so numerous that the Court can take judicial notice of them &#8212; where valuable franchises have been given away, or sold for a song. Physical assets tie up a large proportion of the capital. Their purpose is to make money. If the undertaking fails, the physical assets bring very little as a rule. An enterprise that can bring in money without physical assets does not have to make repairs, pay property taxes, set aside a depreciation reserve, or lose interest on the money tied up in a costly plant. This reason affected Messrs. Strong and Yeadon only; Mr. Bruner did consider this \"scrap of paper\" valuable (page 369).\n\n2.  That the franchise might be lost.  This reason appears to be based on an unfounded fear, the Courts having already declared this franchise to be a permanent and vested right in the Crosswell Corporation.\n\n3.  That there was a growing clamor for the sale of beer,  and that Coca-Cola might lose its popularity.  Such a fear in 1930 was absolutely speculative. The long history of this drink shows an ever-increasing popularity. The sale of beer was not made legal until more than three years had elapsed; and then, instead of losing ground, Coca-Cola gained.\n\n4.  That additional taxes might be imposed.  Mr. Ellis of Asheville was specially emphatic in his opinion on this point. He stated that he had found it necessary to spend several months in Raleigh fighting such a tax for North Carolina. My finding on this fear is that it is not well founded. The one-cent tax had been on for several years. The purpose of such a tax being to produce revenue, the Legislature would be very unlikely to impose a prohibitive tax, which would defeat the primary purpose of the levy. A person who has had typhoid fever might have a second attack, but it is improbable. Since there is no such tax in North Carolina, holders of such a contract have good grounds to fear, and that no doubt, in all sincerity, colored Mr. Ellis's testimony on this point.\n\n5.  That asset was speculative and too large a part of the  estate was invested therein.  \"There were too many eggs in one basket.\" The half interest in this corporation, twenty-five shares, constituted almost half the value of the whole estate. That they had a sacred trust to perform and that, if they held this asset, and it began losing money, they would be blamed. It is necessary only to read the will to answer this. Mr. Crosswell, himself, assumed responsibility for such a result.\n\n6.  That the trustees could not give their time to it; there  was no one to put in Mr. Crosswell's place.  I must speak with some diffidence on this point. My own inference from\nthe codicil to the will is that Mr. Bruner was in Mr. Crosswell's mind as the manager of this business since he had been in more or less complete charge of it for some time; the business had been carried on from Mrs. Lumpkin's plant in Columbia. To a disinterested onlooker, this plan would seem not only feasible, but natural and reasonable. How seriously the trustees regarded this problem, I hesitate to say, since it would depend very largely on Mr. Bruner's attitude and statements to them on this point, and there is no testimony on which to base such an opinion.\n\n7.  That there was a world-wide depression in October,  1929. That Coca-Cola, being a luxury, would be among the  first commodities to suffer.  I find that there is much merit in this reason. Whether it was the controlling reason is open to question. The best comment on this reason is found in the testimony of Mr. H.D. Osteen (page 168). In drawing the distinction between speculation and investment on the stock exchange, he said he would be inclined to sell quickly on a declining market if he were speculating; \"but if I had an investment in a stock and I had the earning statement before me and saw it was making money and paying dividends, I would not be apt to throw it over.\"\n\nQuestion by Mr. Herbert: \"You don't think if you were charged with the holding of that stock in an important trust, that whether or not you should sell it or hold it might be influenced by what happened to the other stocks?\" Answer: \"Well, if you are going that far with it, figuring you were supposed to get a return from that money,  you should consider  what you would do with the money after you turn that  stock loose. Everything else was going down; why sell that  and go into something else?\" \n\nSince this is one of the hinges of the door to this problem, I shall discuss it more fully in the second part of this report.\n\n8.  That Mrs. Lumpkin's salary could not be cut, since the  estate owned only a half interest in the corporation. \n\nThe question of salary allowance bulked larger than any other in the testimony presented at the hearings in this cause. The refusal of Mrs. Lumpkin to allow her salary to be cut appears to my mind to have been the moving cause of the sale. Mr. Strong came back from Columbia completely discouraged as to the chances of operating the corporation on the economical basis suggested in the will. He reached the conclusion then and there that the business ought to be sold.\n\nHe broached the subject to Mr. Yeadon, who was much disturbed, but was reluctant to go over the provision of the will as to retaining this stock. Unquestionably the salaries fixed at that meeting reduced the income of the orphanage as a brief calculation clearly shows. The return of the appraisers shows the average net income for the preceding five years to have been $38,324.00, from which $2,500.00 was deducted for salary account, leaving $35,824.00, which is 7 per cent. on $511,770.00. Half of this is $255,885.00.\n\nIf, however, instead of deducting the proposed $2,500.00 for salaries, there was actually deducted $16,800.00, as fixed at the board meeting, the net income for distribution as dividends would be $21,524.00. On a 7 per cent. basis the whole stock would be worth $307,483.00; and half of it would, of course, be $153,741.50.\n\nAnother calculation shows that the estate's half of the net income, $10,762.00, would be a little less than 4 1/4 per cent. on the sale price, to wit, $10,875.11. Mr. Yeadon gradually came to the same conclusion that Mr. Strong had earlier reached. Mr. Bruner seems to have taken very little part in these discussions, but he concurred in the result. The other seven reasons were simply cumulative and served to confirm them in the view that the point had been reached where it was to the manifest advantage of the estate to sell.\n\n              III. WHAT WOULD BE A REASONABLE SALARY? \nAs was stated above, so much testimony was directed to this question that I feel it my duty to make a finding thereon.\n\nThe defendants brought as witnesses five men of great prominence and experience in dealing with Coca-Cola, all of whom testified that a salary account of $20,500.00 was very reasonable; that their businesses had a larger salary account; that they would not consider handling the business for such a salary. It developed, however, that these men were managing subbottling plants in addition to their first-line bottling contracts; that these bottling plants required much more detailed work and credit risk than the first-line bottling contract; that they controlled the stock of their corporations, and as a consequence, fixed their own salaries. It is only human that this pleasant task would be approached in a spirit of generosity and high consideration for the value of their own services.\n\nThe State produced an expert accountant, Mr. Hagen, who had made a thorough investigation of the business, Mr. Chandler, a man of large experience in the Coca-Cola business, and three other citizens of this city, more or less familiar with the handling of brokerage concerns. They all testified that $2,500.00 would be a reasonable amount for salaries. That since each subbottling plant sent in, as a rule, only two orders a month, there were usually something over fifty and less than a hundred items a month; that there was practically no credit risk involved, for no subbottler would be likely to jeopardize his franchise by failing to pay his bills; that the goods were shipped direct to the plants from Atlanta, and only the orders and drafts were handled in the Columbia office, which was almost entirely a matter of bookkeeping. Under cross examination some admitted that four or five thousand a year might not be unreasonable, if there were much responsibility involved, but for the actual management $2,500.00 would be good pay.\n\nThe board of appraisers, which, as I said above, could not be improved upon, fixed $2,500.00 as the proper amount for salaries. It is to be noted that one of the present trustees,\nMr. Riley, was on that board, and agreed to this proposition.\n\nFinally, Mr. Crosswell, himself, must have had some such amount in mind. When he was in active charge, he drew $2,500.00 more than Mrs. Lumpkin. For some years before his death, Mr. Bruner did the actual work beginning at a salary of about $100.00 per month, which was gradually increased to $150.00 per month. The testimony of Mr. Hagen is of especial weight, not only on account of his character and intelligence, but because he has audited the accounts of a great number of concerns in this section, no one is better qualified to speak.\n\nAll the pioneering constructive work of building up the enterprise had long since been done. Every available bottling area had been brought in and put to work. If any one plant had failed, it could readily have been disposed of. There was nothing more to do along this line. There seems to have been little difficulty in holding the plants up to the proper standard, for they would not dare take the risk of losing their contracts. A series of questions evidently based on an affidavit hereinafter referred to was submitted to each witness, tending to show the grave responsibilities resting on the management of such an enterprise. The principal duty was inspection of the bottling plants. It is pleasant to note that Mr. Bruner frankly stated that the parent company maintained a strict watch on such matters, sent out trained inspectors from Atlanta, and had in fact relieved the first-line bottlers of this responsibility. He spoke with candor and showed no desire to evade. The danger of forfeiting the franchise had been reduced to a minimum.\n\nIt is, therefore, very difficult for the Master to find any justification for large salaries for the management of a perfectly adjusted machine, which runs as smoothly as a Waltham watch.\n\nI am mindful, however, that Mrs. Lumpkin is even now paying Mr. Bruner a salary of $6,000.00. The purchase of\nthis half interest against Mr. Bruner's advice makes it easy to believe that she has a better business head than the Master. Nevertheless, I am unable to see how the work or responsibility involved can justify a salary account of $16,800.00, which was the amount that faced the trustees.\n\nThe trustees were asked why they did not find some means to reduce these salaries to an economical basis. Counsel insisted that resort should have been had to the Court to obtain this result. This brings us to the affidavit made by Mr. Crosswell, himself, to the Internal Revenue Bureau to justify the large salary account referred to in the will. When this document was presented. I could see no reason to admit it into evidence, since there is no possible construction thereof that could bind this Court in its inquiry into the sale. Furthermore. I did not even consider it any sort of evidence as to proper salaries, for the testator strongly intimated that these had been made large for a special reason, which could have been nothing other than to reduce the income tax &#8212; a plan that he was using even as far back as 1915, when the will was drawn. The affidavit was prepared for the particular purpose of impressing the bureau. No criticism can come from citizens of this State, who unanimously misrepresent the value of their property in tax returns and think nothing of it.\n\nBut a copy of this affidavit was shown to the trustees. The State is seeking to discover why they sold. This affidavit made a serious impression on them. They felt that if they took this question to Court, they would immediately be confronted with the testator's own affidavit that such salaries were reasonable and proper. I, therefore, hold that this affidavit is relevant to this inquiry so far as it affected the minds of the trustees. I do not feel that I could allow it to influence in the slightest degree my own judgment on this question.\n\nMr. Strong was asked why he, as a director of the corporation, did not demand an equal salary appropriation for\nthe estate, the bulk of which could have been turned over to the orphanage after paying a reasonable salary to the manager. It will have to be admitted that such a plan depended on Mr. Bruner's attitude in the matter. Mr. Bruner did not see it in that light. As a result, Messrs. Strong and Yeadon frankly admitted that they did not feel able to cope with the situation. They therefore, decided that they could not get the economical management suggested by the will, and that the best way out was to sell out.\n\nThe auditor's report shows that there was actually a decline in the receipts during the succeeding four years; the average, however, including the fifth year, being approximately the same as the five years on which the appraisers based their report. For a few years, their fears seemed justified. But the long view gives a different aspect. After the depression, the income has increased surprisingly. Even during the depression, these shares held their own better than almost any other kind of property.\n\nUnquestionably, the orphanage is the loser by the sale. It is likely that the loss will be increasingly apparent.\n\nBut this was a mistake in judgment. It was not due to negligence or to any intention to abuse the trust committed to them by the testator.\n\n                        CONCLUSIONS OF LAW                           I. Plea in Bar \nAs was said above, should this plea be sustained, it would immediately end the inquiry.\n\nI cannot regard an order on an  ex parte  proceeding in the Probate Court as final and binding on the beneficiaries of a trust, particularly if there are minors, unless they were brought before the Court. To preclude any inquiry into the  bona fides  of a transaction, the parties must all have been before the Court in the original hearing.\n\nIf the method prescribed by statute has been followed, any inquiry that raises a question of good judgment only should be barred.\n\nIf, as contended by the State, the three trustees undertook to do something that was reserved for the board of five to be appointed when the orphanage was established, no order of the Probate Court could give them the power not conferred by the will. If the acts of the three trustees were  ultra vires , no order of the Probate Court could effectively and finally confirm them. This is a question arising on the face of the record.\n\nLikewise, if wrongdoing were charged, it is difficult to see how the State could be prevented from inquiring into it. Just as nature abhors a vacuum, so equity abhors a wrong without a remedy. Constructive fraud has the same legal effect as actual fraud.\n\nWhen the prescribed method has been followed, the transaction is  prima facie  good, and must not lightly be disturbed. For this reason, a certificate by the executive law officer of the State is properly a requisite. Only the most substantial grounds should justify any attempt to set aside the acts of executors or trustees who have pursued the orderly method set out by statute. Mere dissatisfaction with the result, or ill-founded suspicion, would not justify the Attorney General in approving a proceeding. This is based on reasonable inferences from the case of  Hood v.  Cannon ,  178 S.C. 94 ,  182 S.E., 306 , and the cases therein cited.\n\nI conclude, as a matter of law, that the Attorney General was justified in authorizing this inquiry, whatever may be its final outcome. This plea should be dismissed.\n\n                 II. Were Five Trustees Necessary? \nThe State contends that this stock was a special gift to the orphanage with a solemn injunction to hold it for that purpose; that this was a particular bequest\nin Paragraph VIII of the will and was not included in the general power of sale given to the three trustees in Paragraph XI.\n\nThe principle that, \"if two provisions of a will conflict, the latter governs,\" does not apply here. These two provisions may both stand under two different theories which lead to opposite conclusions.\n\nThe theory of the counsel for the State seems reasonable and logical. If Mr. Crosswell intended this stock as a particular bequest to the five trustees of the orphanage, Paragraph VIII could perfectly well stand, leaving Paragraph XI to apply to all property not so particularly bequeathed. This was the view to which the Master was first inclined. The Master still recognizes that this interpretation does not do violence to the terms of the will or to the laws governing the interpretation of wills.\n\nBut such an interpretation is not exclusive. The possibility of another interpretation that likewise does not involve the revoking of Paragraph VIII by Paragraph XI convinced me that a more thorough study of the whole will was necessary in order to gather the true intention of the testator.\n\nThe two additional trustees were to be named  by the  original three  when  in their discretion  the proper time to establish the orphanage had arrived. There was to be  a period of accumulation . The testator evidently had in mind that this should not exceed seven years. During the period of accumulation the three beyond any question had complete dominion over all the assets of the estate, subject, so far as the Coca-Cola stock was concerned, to the solemn admonition not to sell until a point had been reached where it would be to the manifest interest of his estate to sell. (He does not use the word \"orphanage\" in this connection.) A possibility that it might be for the best interest of the estate to sell was in the testator's mind. That much is beyond question. Either the three or the five certainly had\nthat right. Neither in 1915 when the will was drawn, nor in 1928 when the codicil was appended, could the testator foresee what circumstances might arise that would make it manifestly advantageous to sell. There is nothing to sustain the theory that \"it should not be sold at any early time after his death, but if a point should be reached  in the long  course of time ,\" etc. Mr. Crosswell fixed no time in this will. The time for sale, if sold at all, was to be determined by circumstances and conditions. It is so evident that such conditions might develop  during the period of accumulation \nbefore the board of five was to be established that I cannot believe the testator intended to postpone this right until the full orphanage board was organized. I am forced to this conclusion in spite of the fact that I disagree with the trustees as to the wisdom of the sale.\n\nAnother feature of the will that affected my mind convincingly was the iterated and reiterated expression of confidence in his executors throughout the will. Of course, when the will was drawn in 1915, this referred only to Messrs. Yeadon and Strong, since Mr. Bruner started working for him in 1923. They had helped him to build the great wholesale enterprise which he regarded so highly that he refers to it as \"a living monument to the name it bears.\" They were not only faithful and efficient assistants, but they had become his most highly esteemed friends. He knew them thoroughly &#8212; even their limitations which they themselves so candidly admit (for instance, that they were inexperienced in dealing in stocks or in the details of the Coca-Cola business). He begins his will by giving to them the dominion over all his property of whatsoever kind. In 1928, when the codicil was added, Mr. Bruner had been working for him about five years &#8212; long enough to learn to know him well. Mr. Bruner was added to this select group.\n\nThe testator not only selected these three as agents to carry out his noble purpose, but he intrusted to them the\nselecting of two other discreet men to fill out the orphanage board when the proper time should arrive. If these three had entertained any improper plans to profit personally from this trust, they might have selected \"dummies\"; they most certainly would not have selected C.G. Rowland and John J. Riley.\n\nI find, however, that the approval of the transaction by these two as testified to by them at the trial could not now ratify an attempted sale made before they took office. If the sale by the three was void, there is nothing for them to ratify. The separate answer in this cause precludes such position. I conclude, therefore, that during the period of accumulation the  three  trustees had the power of sale.\n\n                   III. Precatory or Mandatory? \nAs a corollary to the above conclusions, I find that the desire expressed in the will that the stock be retained can not be construed as an absolute mandate not to sell. The words: \"I do not desire my trustees to sell the stock unless it shall be manifestly to the benefit of my estate to part with it\" are followed immediately by the words, \"in the event that a point is reached,\" etc., indicated beyond any question that the stock could be sold. The testator recognized that he was no prophet &#8212; that no man knows what the future holds. He did not specify the conditions precedent to such a sale. I can not see any possibility of construing the words as mandatory.\n\nIt is true that the word \"manifest\" is a very strong word. The testator leaves no doubt that he wished this stock to be held. He knew its value. He realized that Coca-Cola is a commodity ever growing in popularity. He could think of nothing better into which the money could be put. In the Master's opinion, he was right. But, he did leave an opening for a sale, \"when a point is reached where it shall be to the manifest benefit of my estate to sell the stock.\"\n\n                       IV. Manifest to Whom? \nIn the case of  Jennings v. Teague ,  14 S.C. 229 , one of the greatest of South Carolina Judges, Chief Justice McIver, declared the law which seems to be the answer to this question:\n\n\"So that the real question in this case is, whether the contingency upon which the power to sell was given had happened at the time the sale was made, and as subsidiary to this, who was to determine whether the contingency had happened. To solve these questions it will be necessary to inquire what was the nature of the condition. Was it the happening of a distinct and independent fact, or was it a condition, which, in its very nature, involved the exercise of judgment or discretion for the determination of whether it had happened, and about which, therefore, there might well be, as there was in this very case, honest difference of opinion. It certainly was not a distinct and independent fact, as if the testator had provided that the executor should sell when a certain person should attain to a certain age, but it was a condition, the happening of which could only be determined by an exercise of judgment. When the value of property should recover from a depression caused by a war, or by any other special circumstance, must necessarily be a question to be determined by the exercise of judgment &#8212; one about which persons might and probably would honestly differ.\n\n\"What was to be the extent of the recovery which would authorize a sale? Somebody must judge of this, and if the executor is not permitted to do so, then it is difficult to suggest who could. If the executor commits an error of judgment in determining such a question, that, certainly, ought not to invalidate a sale made by him in the honest exercise of his judgment. If it did, then it would be impossible to tell, until after it was tested by a judicial proceeding, whether any sale made under such a power was valid, and if such a rule be established it would destroy all chances of\nmaking such a sale, for, certainly, no one would buy with the prospect of having his title inquired into and assailed years after upon the ground that the executor had committed an error of judgment in determining a question which was left to his discretion.\n\n\"It is perfectly manifest that the testator in this case intended to invest his executor with power to sell in a certain contingency, the happening of which must necessarily be determined by an exercise of judgment, and unless his executor &#8212; the person whom he has selected as possessing more of his confidence than anyone else &#8212; is authorized to determine this question, then the purpose of conferring upon the executor the power to sell would be practically defeated. * * *\n\n\"When, therefore, as in this case, a power of sale is given to an executor, upon the happening of a contingency which can only be ascertained by the exercise of judgment and discretion, and the executor, in the honest exercise of his judgment, determines that such contingency has happened and accordingly makes the sale, such sale cannot be invalidated, even though it should be made to appear, in the light of subsequent events, that the executor had committed an error of judgment in determining whether the contingency had happened upon which he was authorized to sell. If, however, it should appear that the executor erred wilfully, or from such gross negligence as would imply wilfullness, then it would be different, and the question whether the sale should be allowed to stand, would depend largely upon whether the purchaser had notice of such misconduct upon the part of the executor. In this case, as we have seen, there is no foundation for a suspicion even that the executor acted otherwise than honestly in determining whether the contingency had happened upon which he was authorized to sell, and, therefore, upon the principles above stated there is no ground for invalidating the sale.\"\n\nThe Master made several attempts to analyze and shorten this citation but gave up the attempt as hopeless &#8212; nothing can be taken from it, nothing added. It is a perfect statement of the law governing such matter.\n\nThe gift of the power to his trustees by Mr. Crosswell is as effectual and binding on the Court as the gift of the corpus to the orphanage. The will speaks only to the donees of the power; there is not even a suggestion that they should take their problems to anyone else.\n\n            CAN THE ASSIGNMENT BY THE EXECUTORS STAND? \nThe will provides that the sale be made by the trustees. The signatures on the assignment of the stock were followed by the word \"executors.\" On the face of the record the natural answer would be \"no.\" That may be the correct answer. The will gave the power of sale to the trustees &#8212; not to the executors.\n\nEquity owes its birth to the desire to look beneath the rigid rules of the law &#8212; to seek substantial justice. In the spirit of this purpose we must examine the transaction more closely. This will was artificially drawn by a scrivener learned in the law, no one knew better than he the distinction between an executor and a trustee. Yet these words are used interchangeably many times in the will. Duties are assigned to trustees that are incontestably within the province of executors. Why was this? The most reasonable explanation is that the same three being both executors and trustees, it was immaterial which term was used.\n\nLet us look into the sale itself. Strong, Yeadon, and Bruner met, as they had frequently done. It is unlikely that they would say at one time, \"We are meeting as executors\"; at another, \"We are now meeting as trustees.\" Such a procedure would strike us as foolish. They consider this sale without any question as to whether the same three were acting as executors or as trustees. The\nname under which they were acting could not conceivably have affected their decision one way or the other. A trade was entered into with Mrs. Lumpkin. The minds of the contracting parties met. The price and terms were agreed upon. The sale was made. The assignment on the back of the certificates of stock was a mere detail in the formality of closing the sale. If the three did not have the power of sale, it is void no matter what title they wrote after their names. If they had such power, and entered into a valid agreement with an innocent purchaser and had then refused to sign at all, such purchaser could have asked the Court to make them comply. The Court would certainly not have heard them if they offered as a defense that they were meeting as executors, not as trustees, when they made their agreement. The Courts permit a deed, the most solemn instrument known to the law, to be corrected. If the omission of the word \"trustees\" was an inadvertence occurring after every feature of the contract had been agreed upon by the identical three who were also executors, it is difficult to find any substance in this objection.\n\nI hold that it was an irregularity &#8212; not a defect. If it is a defect, adding the word \"trustee\" at the hearing cannot cure this. Since, as has been said, the Master does not agree with the trustees as to the wisdom of the sale, there naturally came the temptation to use this mistake as a peg upon which to hang a recommendation to set aside the sale. But such a procedure would assuredly violate the spirit of equity.\n\nIn the  California case, Goad v. Montgomery , 119 Cal., 552 ,  51 P., 681 , 63 Am. St. Rep., 145, the same three were executors and trustees as in this case, but the language of the Court shows that they held those offices \"successively\"; that they undertook as trustees to exercise a power given only to the executors  after they had been discharged from  that office . In the instant case, they held both offices simultaneously. The sale actually took place during the administration\nyear before they could possibly have been discharged as executors. The  California case  differs from this therefore in a very essential particular.\n\nWhen parties in good faith enter into a solemn contract, the Court cannot interfere except for substantial reasons. In the instant case no sufficient reasons have been presented to me to avoid this sale. I must therefore recommend that the sale be confirmed.", "procedural_history": "", "scdb_id": "", "sibling_ids": [3884678], "source": "ZU", "status": "Published", "suitNature": "", "syllabus": ""}

Ever then, when an act of any department is challenged, because not warranted by the Constitution, the existence of the authority is to be ascertained by determining whether the power has been conferred by the Constitution, either in express terms or by lawful implication, to be drawn from the express authority conferred or deduced as an attribute which legitimately inheres in the nature of the powers given, and which flows from the character of the government established by the Constitution. In other words, whilst confined to its constitutional orbit, the government of the United States is supreme within its lawful sphere.</p> <p>Every function of the government being thus derived from the Constitution, it follows that that instrument is everywhere and at all times potential in so far as its provisions are applicable.</p> <p>Hence it is that wherever a power is given by the Constitution and there is a limitation imposed on the authority, such restriction operates upon and confines every action on the subject within its constitutional limits.</p> <p>Consequently it is impossible to conceive that where conditions are brought about to which any particular provision of the Constitution applies its controlling influence may be frustrated by the action of any or all of the departments of the government. Those departments, when discharging, within the limits of their constitutional power, the duties which rest on them, may of course deal with the subjects committed to them in such a way as to cause the matter dealt with to come under the control of provisions of the Constitutions which may not have been previously applicable. But this does not conflict with the doctrine just stated, or presuppose that the Constitution may or may not be applicable at the election of any agency of the government.</p> <p>The Constitution has undoubtedly conferred on Congress the right to create such municipal organizations as it may deem best for all the territories of the United States whether they have been incorporated or not, to give to the inhabitants as respects the local governments such degree of representation as may be conducive to the public well-being, to deprive such territory of representative government if it is considered just to do so, and to change such local governments at discretion.</p> <p>As Congress in governing the territories is subject to the Constitution, it results that all the limitations of the Constitution which are applicable to Congress in exercising this authority necessarily limit its power on this subject. It follows also that every provision of the Constitution which is applicable to the territories is also controlling therein. To justify a departure from this elementary principle by a criticism of the opinion of Mr. Chief Justice Taney in Scott v. Sand/ord, 19 How. 393, is unwarranted. Whatever inay be the view entertained of the correctness of the opinion of the court in that case, in so far as it interpreted a particular provision of the Constitution concerning slavery and decided that as so construed it was in force in the territories, this in no way affects the principle which that decision announced, that the applicable \u2022 provisions of the Constitution were operative.</p> <p>Tn the case of the territories, as in every other instance, when a provision of the Constitution is invoked, the question which arises is, not whether the Constitution is operative, for that is self-evident, but whether the pro- . vision relied on is applicable.</p> <p>As Congress derives its authority to levy local taxes for local purposes within the territories, not from the general grant of power to tax as expressed in the Constitution, it follows that its right to locally tax is not to be measured by the provision empowering Congress \u2018i To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts, and Excises,\u201d and is not restrained by the requirement of uniformity throughout the United States. But the power . just referred, to, as well as the qualification of uniformity, restrains Congress from imposing an impost duty on goods coming into the United States from a territory which has been incorporated into and forms a part of the United States. This results because the clause of the Constitution in .question does not confer upon Congress power to impose such an impost duty on goods coming from one part of the United States to another part thereof, and such duty besides would be repugnant to the requirement of . uniformity throughout the United States.</p> <p>By Mr. Justice Gbay.</p> <p>The civil government of the United States cannot extend immediately, and of its oWn force, over territory acquired by war. Such territory must necessarily, in the first instance, be governed by the military power under the control of the President as commander in chief. Civil government cannot take effect at once, as soon as possession is acquired under military authority, or even as soon as that possession is confirmed by treaty. It can only be put in operation by the action of the appropriate-political department of the government, at such time and in such degree as that department may determine.</p> <p>In a conquered territory, civil government must take effect, either by the action of the treaty-making power, or by that of the Congress of the United States. The office of a treaty of cession ordinarily is to put an end to all authority of the foreign government over the territory; and to subject the territory to the disposition of the Government of the United States.</p> <p>The government and disposition of territory so acquired belong to the Government of the United States, consisting of the President, the Senate, elected by the States, and the House of Representatives, chosen by and immediately representing the people of the United States.</p> <p>So long as Congress has not incorporated the territory into the United States, neither military occupation nor cession by treaty makes the conquered territory domestic territory, in the sense of the revenue laws. But those laws concerning \u201c foreign countries \u201d remain applicable to the conquered territory, until changed by Congress.-</p> <p>If Congress is not ready to construct a complete government for the conquered territory, it may establish a temporary government, which is not subject to all the restrictions of the Constitution.</p>"}

Affirmed.Action for libel brought by E.O. Black against The State Company. The complaint is set out in opinion on former appeal, in  93 S.C. 467 ,  77 S.E. 51 , which see, in connection with the opinion on this hearing, for statement of facts.\n\nThe charge, remarks of the trial Court in refusing a new trial, and exceptions were as follows:\n\nMr. Foreman and gentlemen of the jury, I feel it my duty to call to your attention the fact that you are trying the case of E.O. Black against The State Company. You are the judges of the credibility of the witnesses and the force and effect to be given to their testimony. I might say, gentlemen, as far as the facts are concerned, you are the Supreme Court, and you would deport yourselves as judges; therefore, you would approach the consideration of the matters that are now being submitted to you in a judicial frame of mind, remembering that you have no enemies to punish and no friends to reward. Hold the scales of justice evenly balanced between the plaintiff and the defendant. That is what you are sworn to do. You must try this case according to the law as I give it to you as applied to the facts as you understand them to be. Therefore, if you have any extraneous or improper matters before you you are to discard them, ignore them, and make an honest effort to well and truly try the issues that are submitted to you for your consideration.\n\nYour decision on matters of fact is final, and there is no appeal from such decision. When you have given the case your honest, conscientious consideration and reached what you conceive to be a proper verdict honestly no man can criticise you. You are to be untrammeled in the performance of your duty.\n\nNow, having said that much, gentlemen, you want to know what are the issues that are submitted to you. I charge you, gentlemen, that all persons are equal in the Courts of law, and they all have the same rights under the law.\n\nThe plaintiff is a natural person. The defendant is also a person, but the defendant is made a person by artificial process, to wit, by enactment of the legislature. It is a corporation.\n\nCorporations and individuals should be given the same fairness in the trial of a case that might arise between them, between the person on the one side and the corporation on the other.\n\nCorporations, gentlemen, cannot act except through agents; and the corporation known as The State Company cannot act except through its editors, reporters and other agents, business manager, president, vice president, and so forth. The agents of a corporation, within the scope of their authority as agents, bind the corporation to the act of the agents as the act of the corporation itself.\n\nNow, you would approach the trial of the differences that exist between the contention of the plaintiff and the contention of the defendant as you would try a case between anybody else or any other persons. You are arbiters, as it were. And you would try the case just the same as if you were settling the differences between two neighbors that had appealed to you and some of your other neighbors to arbitrate some differences between them.\n\nThe plaintiff comes into Court, and he has a right, any plaintiff who feels aggrieved has a right to come into Court\nand seek to remedy or right his alleged grievances; and he alleges in his complaint &#8212; and the complaint and answer frame the issues that this Court with the jury are to try &#8212; and he alleges that certain publications were made by the defendant which damaged him in his reputation, standing and business, and things of that kind. In other words, it is a suit for what is known as a libel suit. And these allegations in his complaint that it is material for me to call to your attention are, after setting forth the alleged publications, he alleges that The State editorial in connection with the locals on Page one of said paper, having reference to it, directs public attention to the plaintiff herein, E.O. Black, and denominates his method of fighting the said Wilson as unfair and discreditable, and that the said libelous publication was malicious and false, and tends to impeach the honesty, integrity and reputation of the plaintiff herein, and, therefore, to expose him to public hatred, contempt and ridicule and obloquy and to injure him in his business and occupation.\n\nHe alleges, further, that the said publications set out in this complaint were wilful, malicious and false, and tends to impeach the honesty, integrity and reputation of the plaintiff, to injure his character and reputation, and to expose him to public hatred, contempt, ridicule or obloquy, and to injure his business or occupation, and by reason thereof the said plaintiff has been damaged in the sum of fifty thousand dollars.\n\nNow, the editorials and the publications or communications &#8212; because a publication is a communication by the publisher, from the publisher to the public &#8212; he alleges, having set these out, he makes these allegations about them as I have called your attention briefly to. The editorials, or rather the publications, have been read in your hearing several times and I do not deem it necessary to read them again, even if they are in the complaint.\n\nNow, the answer has a first defense. As I understand the first defense to mean, in effect a general denial of the material allegations of the complaint.\n\nThe second defense, while it is somewhat lengthy, may be summed up briefly as follows: \"That the publications alleged in the newspaper of this defendant, in so far as they referred to plaintiff, were made by defendant in the fulfillment of its duty to its subscribers and to the public as an honest report and criticism of the methods used by the plaintiff and others, and with reference to their action in a matter of vital public interest and concern, and were made by defendant upon reliable information, with an honest belief in their truth and without malice or intention to injure the plaintiff or the other brother of the said Fingal C. Black.\"\n\nAnd the third defense, briefly stated, reading from the answer, they allege in the answer: \"That the statements set forth in the publications in the newspaper of this defendant, as alleged in the complaint, in so far as they refer to the plaintiff, contain a true statement of the things done by plaintiff.\"\n\nFor a fourth defense, all of which I will read, the defendant says: \"That the statements made in the publications in the newspaper of this defendant, as alleged in the complaint, in so far as they referred to plaintiff, were made by defendant upon reliable information furnished to defendant and honestly believed by defendant to be true, for the sole purpose of performing its public duty of furnishing the news to its subscribers and readers and of making a fair and honest editorial comment upon the action of the plaintiff on a matter of general public concern and interest.\"\n\nI charge you, gentlemen, as a matter of law, that before the plaintiff can recover at your hands he must satisfy you by the preponderance of the evidence, either his testimony or the testimony of others, either for the defense or for the\nplaintiff, that his contentions set out in his complaint are true. He is not called upon to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt, but by the preponderance of the evidence. And the preponderance of the evidence means this &#8212; the greater weight of the testimony; not necessarily means the greater number of witnesses. For example, you take an imaginary scale or balance and in one side place all the testimony in favor of the contention of the plaintiff and in the other side the testimony against his contention; and if it stand evenly balanced he cannot recover, because there is no preponderance, and there is no preponderance in his behalf to sustain his contention. But if his side of the balance in your mental picture predominates in the least, then it can be said that his contentions have been made out because there lies the preponderance.\n\nThis, gentlemen, is a suit for libel, generally known as a suit for libel. Therefore, you would like to know briefly what a libel is, and I quote from the dissenting opinion in this case from the Supreme Court in order to get the definition, a complete definition of libel. Of course, the majority opinion of the Supreme Court governs this Court: \"A libel is malicious defamation, expressed either by writing or printing, or by signs, pictures, effigies, or the like, tending to blacken the memory of one who is dead, or to impeach the honesty or integrity or reputation, or publish the natural or alleged defects of one who is alive, and thereby to expose him to public hatred, contempt, ridicule, or obloquy, or to cause him to be shunned or avoided, or to injure him in his office, business or occupation.\"\n\nI charge you, gentlemen, as a matter of law, that a man's reputation, standing, character and things of that kind are his property just as much as his personal goods and chattels or his real estate; and a man who unlawfully injures that possession is liable in damages under the law in a proper case.\n\nJust in this connection, counsel referred to section 214 of the Code Civil Proc., and I desire to read that section and also the following section, which is the law in this case, although it refers mainly &#8212; I mean to say, which is a part of the law of this case &#8212; referring mainly, though, to pleadings. Section 214 of the new Code Civil Proc.: \"In an action for libel or slander it shall not be necessary to state, in the complaint, any extrinsic facts, for the purpose of showing the application to the plaintiff of the defamatory matter out of which the cause of action arose; but it shall be sufficient to state generally that the same was published or spoken concerning plaintiff; and if such allegation be controverted the plaintiff shall be bound to establish, on trial, that it was so published or spoken.\"\n\nThat means, gentlemen, that you must be satisfied by the preponderance of the evidence that the alleged libel was written of and concerning the plaintiff in this case.\n\nSection 215: \"In the action mentioned in the last section, defendant may, in his answer, allege both the truth of the matter charged as defamatory, and any mitigating circumstances, to reduce the amount of damages; and, whether he prove the justification or not, he may give, in evidence, the mitigating circumstances.\"\n\nThat, of course, is only read in connection with the other section; and, as I indicated, is more a matter of pleading than anything else.\n\nI charge you, gentlemen, that this suit is for damages; and the kind of damages claimed in the pleading is what is known as actual or compensatory damages, and also punitive damages.\n\nActual damages means compensatory damages to compensate the person for his injury or damage. Punitive damages has nothing to do with actual damages, but is allowed by way of punishment for the unlawful invasion of the rights of a person. As an example, it is sometimes called exemplary damages, as an example to others.\n\nYou will notice that in the definition of libel that I charge you it starts off with \"malicious defamation.\" Therefore, you will note that you must understand what malicious or malice is. You have an idea in everyday common affairs what malice means, but the broad legal sense of the word is the wilful or intentional doing of a wrongful act without just cause or excuse. I copied one of the definitions &#8212; had an opportunity to copy one of the definitions of malice from a law book: \"The term malice in its broad sense imports that state of mind or feeling which prompts an individual to do an act whereby another is or may be injured wrongfully and intentionally, without just cause or excuse.\"\n\nThe defendant being a corporation and having to act through agents it becomes necessary for me to instruct you briefly concerning the law of agent and principal. Generally speaking, the agent, his conduct and his acts, within the scope of his authority, is binding on the principal. I charge you, further, that the acts, all acts of the agent, whether within the scope of his authority or not at the time, if his acts are ratified subsequently by the principal, then the principal makes those acts the acts of themselves or itself.\n\nWith that, gentlemen, I take up the requests to charge. I take up the plaintiff's first. I should instruct you, gentlemen, and the requests cannot give you, all the law applicable to a case in one proposition. Therefore, you will bring your best attention to the charge of the Court, seeking to understand the whole, and remembering that the propositions submitted to you for your consideration are not intended to be contradictory, but are intended to modify or qualify one or the other.\n\nThe plaintiff requests, first:\n\n\"1. If the jury find that the written words in this case tends to diminish the respectability of the plaintiff to whom they relate and to expose him to disgrace and obloquy, although they do not impute the commission of a crime,\nthey are libelous and actionable although no special damages are alleged or proven.\"\n\nI charge you that, gentlemen, in connection with what I have already charged you along the line that the plaintiff must establish by the preponderance of the evidence that the defamatory publication was of or concerning him.\n\n\"2. In determining whether words are libelous, they are to be given their ordinary and popular meaning, and if they are susceptible of two meanings, one libelous and the other innocent, the former is not to be adopted and the latter rejected as a matter of course, but it must be left to the jury to be determined in what sense they are used.\"\n\nI charge you that, gentlemen.\n\n\"3. I charge you that written words tending to diminish the respectability of a person to whom they relate, and to expose him to disgrace and obloquy, although they do not impute the commission of a crime, are libelous and actionable, although no special damages are alleged or proven.\"\n\nI charge you that, gentlemen, in connection with what I have already said in regard to malice and the duty that the law places upon the plaintiff to show malice, under the definition, of course, of malice that I have given to you.\n\n\"4. I charge you that if you believe from the evidence that the publications attributed to the defendant were published with relation to the plaintiff, and if you further believe that said publications were libelous &#8212; that is, that they tended to diminish the respectability of the plaintiff and to expose him to disgrace and obloquy, although they did not impute the commission of a crime &#8212; then your verdict should be for the plaintiff.\"\n\nI charge you that, gentlemen, modified by what I have already charged you and what I will charge you hereafter from the requests of the defendant.\n\n\"5. I charge you that `in a legal sense, malice, as an ingredient of actions for slander or libel, signifies nothings more\nthan a wrongful act, done intentionally, without just cause or excuse.'\"\n\nI charge you that.\n\n\"6. If the jury find that the plaintiff was threatened by the defendant, and warned that defendant would write him up in The State newspaper and ruin his business, and in pursuance of that threat did attack the plaintiff and the attack was malicious and untrue or exceeded the limits of fair criticism in the discussion of public affairs and the plaintiff unjustly exposed to obloquy and disgrace, then the verdict must be for the plaintiff.\"\n\nI charge you that, gentlemen.\n\n\"7. I charge you that it is usually for the jury to say when criticism and statements cease to be fair and honest and become libelous.\"\n\nI charge you that, gentlemen.\n\n\"8. I charge you that fair and honest criticism in matters of public concern is privileged, but the privilege is limited strictly to comments and criticism and does not extend to protect false statements, unjust inferences, imputation of evil motives or criminal conduct and attacks upon private character, the publisher being responsible for the truth of what he alleges to be facts.\"\n\nI charge you that, gentlemen, modified, of course, and qualified by what I have already charged you and what I will charge you.\n\n\"9. I charge you that the Constitution of the United States and the State Constitution guarantee the right of freedom of speech and liberty of the press. The term `liberty of the press' consists in a right in the conductor of a newspaper to print what he chooses without any previous license, but subject to be held responsible therefore to the same extent that any one else would be responsible for the publication.\"\n\nI charge you that, gentlemen.\n\n\"10. I further charge that the subject in relation to which a communication was made may be privileged, yet the communication made upon that subject may not be privileged. If the restraints and qualifications imposed by law upon the publicity to be given such communications be disregarded, the communication is not privileged. If reasonable bounds be exceeded in making the communication or if the communication be made knowing it to be false malice might be inferred which would destroy the privilege.\"\n\nI charge you that, gentlemen.\n\n\"11. If you find under the law and the facts in this case that the plaintiff is entitled to recover damages, in addition to any actual damages which may have been proven, you may give what in law is known as exemplary or punitive damages &#8212; that is, damages that may be punishment to the defendant and an example to others.\"\n\nI charge you that, gentlemen.\n\nJust here, gentlemen, I desire to take up one of the requests of the defendant out of order; and before I read that request I instruct you that privileged communications are matters for the jury after the Court has instructed you what privileged communications are under the law. In other words, you are to decided whether or not the communications or publications complained of were privileged. And for your guidance I charge you this seventh request of the defendant:\n\n\"7. A communication, to be privileged, must be made upon a proper occasion, from a proper motive, and must be based upon reasonable or proper cause. When so made in good faith the law does not imply malice from the communication itself as in ordinary cases. Actual malice must be proved before there can be a recovery.\n\nI charge you that, gentlemen, recalling to your minds what I defined to you as malice.\n\nNow, going back and taking up the requests of the defendant in order. Some of these, gentlemen, I will have\nto charge with modifications and some of them, of course, I will have to refuse.\n\n\"1. The plaintiff having admitted in his testimony that the only threat of any kind made against him or his business was by one Seats, a reporter, and there being no testimony to show that he had authority to indicate what publications would be made in the paper or to indicate what would be the policy of the paper with reference thereto, the defendant is not legally responsible for any such threats or warnings, even if seriously made by the said Seats.\"\n\nYou will notice, gentlemen, that this is a suit for an alleged libelous publication, and, in the main, it is not a suit for threats or warnings. I charge you that with that suggestion or that comment, and also recalling to your minds what I said about principal and agent.\n\n\"2a. This case presents two distinct questions of fact for the determination of the jury. The first is whether the publications in question are libelous or not libelous. If the jury conclude, under the charge of the Court, that the publications are libelous, then they must, before they can find a verdict for the plaintiff, find the further fact from the preponderance of the testimony, to wit, that the publications were accompanied or caused by express or actual malice.\"\n\nI charge you that, gentlemen.\n\n\"3a. In order for the jury to find that the publications were libelous, they must first find that an agent of the defendant, for whose actions defendant is legally responsible, threatened and warned the plaintiff away from the voting precincts or made the threat that if the plaintiff did not leave the voting precincts and cease his efforts to influence voters against the candidate, Wilson, that the defendant would write up the plaintiff in its newspaper and ruin his business, and that the threat was made seriously with the intention to actually follow it up with the publications in question, and further find, from the preponderance of the testimony, that it was in pursuance of these threats and\nwarnings, that the publications complained of subsequently appeared in defendant's paper.\"\n\nI charge you that, gentlemen, in connection with, and modified by, what I have already charged you in regard to agent and principal.\n\n\"3c. And before the jury can conclude that the publications were libelous they must find from the preponderance of the testimony that the publications were not fair and honest criticisms and strictures upon the conduct of the plaintiff in a matter of public interest.\"\n\nI charge you that, gentlemen.\n\n\"4a. In determining whether words are libelous they are to be given their ordinary and popular meaning; and if they are susceptible of two meanings, one libelous and the other innocent, the former is not to be adopted and the latter rejected as a matter of course, but it must be left to the jury to determine in what sense they were used.\"\n\nI charge you that, gentlemen, I think I have already charged you that mainly in a request by the plaintiff.\n\n\"4b. If the jury conclude that the publications were criticisms upon the conduct of plaintiff in a public matter &#8212; that is, expressions of opinions as to his conduct and not a defamatory charge against the plaintiff himself, then they shall find for the defendant.\"\n\nI charge you that, gentlemen.\n\n\"6. The plaintiff cannot recover unless he proves by the preponderance of the testimony that the defendant was actuated by express malice or malice in fact in making the publications &#8212; that is, he must show by the preponderance of the testimony that the defendant made use of the occasion to gratify anger, malice or some feeling of personal ill will, spite or hatred towards the plaintiff, or that he must show that the defendant made the publications for an indirect, wrongful or wicked motive generally. If the publications are privileged, the plaintiff bears the burden of overcoming\nthe privilege by showing actual or express malice on the part of the defendant.\"\n\nI charge you that, gentlemen.\n\n\"8. `A legal defense to an action for defamation. &#8212; It is a legal defense to an action for defamation if satisfactorily proven, that the circumstances under which the defamatory words were published were such as to render it right and proper that the defendant should plainly state what he honestly believed to be the plaintiff's character &#8212; to speak his mind fully and freely concerning him. In such cases the communication is said to be privileged; and although it may be false, still its publication on such an occasion is excused for the sake of the common convenience and welfare of society at large.'\"\n\nI charge you that, gentlemen, in connection with what I have already charged you.\n\n\"8 1/2. `The evidence should raise a probability of malice, and be more consistent with its existence than its absence. When the occasion is privileged the presumption arises that the publication was  bona fide  and without malice, and it is incumbent on plaintiff to overcome this presumption. If, from defendant's point of view, strong words seem to be justified, he is not to be held liable unless the jury can say that what he published was to some extent, at least, inconsistent with the theory of good faith.' \"\n\n\"11. The jury cannot consider any damages that may have resulted to the corporation known as the Black \nCoulter Company, in which plaintiff was interested and of which he was an officer or any loss suffered by that corporation as a result of the publications.\"\n\nI charge you that because of the simple fact that this is a suit on the part of an individual, E.O. Black, and not on the part of the corporation called the Black  Coulter Company.\n\n\"14. Under the law of this State, it is a complete defense if the jury conclude that the charges contained in\nthe article in question were true, and if the jury so conclude, their verdict shall be for the defendant.\"\n\nI charge you that, gentlemen, in connection with what I have already charged you.\n\n\"15. If the jury conclude that the acts or facts charged against the plaintiff in the publications were true as charged, then they must find that the publications were not libelous, because mere criticisms and expressions of opinion upon the public acts of plaintiff, in which the general public was interested, unless the jury go further and find from the preponderance of the plaintiff's testimony that such publications were caused or accompanied by express or actual malice, as I have heretofore defined that term to you.\"\n\nI charge you that, gentlemen.\n\nRefusing motion for new trial, the Judge said:\n\n\"The question arises, in the first place, was there any testimony tending to sustain the allegations of the complaint as I have just read them from the opinion of the Supreme Court in this case. And I think that is the beginning of the crucial test in this case.\n\n\"There was testimony on that point direct by the plaintiff himself involving, of course, the acts and the statements of an agent of the defendant. I cannot, therefore, hold that there was no testimony to sustain the allegations of the complaint.\n\n\"Now, as to whether it was proven, the jury was entirely the judge of the credibility of the witnesses and the force and effect to be given to their testimony. And I cannot say that the finding of the jury in finding for the plaintiff was against the preponderance of the testimony.\n\n\"Now, then, that brings me to the question as to whether or not there should be a new trial on the ground of after-discovered evidence. And I do not see much difference in the statements brought forward as grounds for a new trial than what was actually testified to by some witnesses.\n\n\"Now, as to the jury, of course, the administration of justice must, and should, be above suspicion. That is, suspicion of any improper motive. It would be a very serious matter to allow a verdict to stand if a juror was prejudiced and allowed that prejudice to govern him in the consideration of the case. But I cannot come to that conclusion in this case as to the juror, Funderburk. Necessarily, where a strong newspaper like The State is published, strong editorials, things of that kind, necessarily some people's feelings will be aroused, hurt, as it were, and strong force always meets with antagonisms and resistance. So, I cannot grant a new trial on that ground, because I think that jury was as fair and unprejudiced a jury as we could get. Even if I would grant a new trial on that ground there would be no assurance that we would have a fairer trial than we have already had in regard to that fact, that matter.\n\n\"Now, the serious question that presents itself to me is the size of the verdict, and that is the fourth ground for asking for the verdict to be set aside. And if I thought, was convinced, that the size of the verdict in this case, that it was a verdict by caprice and passion, I would not hesitate to set it aside on that ground. But I must take into consideration that jurors are not accustomed to deciding on these matters and punishment, and I believe the greater part of that verdict was rendered by way of punishment, and that is a matter that has a wide scope, it is true.\n\n\"Now, as to the actual damages. I do not think that there was much actual damages. It would be speculative and it would be hard to tell what its effect would be on a man's business. But there was no testimony, unfortunately, for that jury as to the wealth of the defendant. There was no argument on that ground. Punishment varies according to the temperament sometimes of the man on the jury who is inflicting the punishment. For instance, I have seen distinguished Judges pass very different sentences on the same offense. I remember one distinguished Judge passing\na $10 sentence on a man for shooting another man through the body with a pistol. Another Judge would no doubt have put him in the penitentiary for ten years, or might have done so. I am not making any criticism of that Judge.\n\n\"So I have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the verdict is largely in excess of what it ought to be, gentlemen. I am here to see that justice is done. I am going to refuse to grant a new trial. The matters of law that were submitted are matters for the Supreme Court, but when it comes to a matter of punishment I must exercise my own judgment.\n\n\"A new trial is granted unless the plaintiff within a reasonable time remit on the record the sum of $15,000, reducing the verdict to $5,000. And I think that is sufficient punishment, because the offense was not, as I see it, the gravest offense that could be committed by a newspaper in the publication of a communication in regard to a man. And that is the order of the Court.\n\n\"They have got, of course, reasonable time. You may make it 15 days in which to determine whether they will accept a new trial or accept a verdict of $5,000.\"\n\nThereafter the defendant appealed on the following exceptions:\n\n1. Because his Honor erred in allowing the plaintiff to testify, over the objection of the defendant, to certain threats claimed to have been made by one A.H. Seats, a reporter of the defendant's paper, to the effect that if plaintiff and his brother, J.E. Black, did not leave the polls and cease their efforts to defeat C.C. Wilson, he (A.H. Seats) would write them up in The State paper and destroy their business, and to further testify: \"You had better leave anyway, because I am going to give you the devil,\" etc.; and further erred in ruling that such threats were in the apparent authority of the agency of the said A.H. Seats.\n\nThe error being that there was no evidence which would justify the inference that A.H. Seats had any authority to bind the defendant corporation by any such declarations or threats, and there was no evidence that any such declarations or threats were in the apparent scope of his authority as an agent of the defendant.\n\n2. Because his Honor erred in allowing the witness, John E. Black, to testify, over the objection of the defendant, to certain threats claimed to have been made by one A.H. Seats, a reporter on the defendant's newspaper, to the effect that he (A.H. Seats) would write up the plaintiff and John E. Black in The State newspaper and destroy their business, unless they ceased their efforts to defeat Charles C. Wilson at the polls; and further erred in ruling that such declarations or threats were within the apparent scope of the authority of the said reporter, Seats.\n\nThe error being that there was no evidence to justify the inference that it was within the apparent authority of the said reporter to bind the defendant corporation by such threats or declarations.\n\n3. Because his Honor erred, for the reasons therein stated, in refusing defendant's motion for the direction of a verdict upon the following ground:\n\n\"(1) Because there is an entire failure of evidence to support the material allegations of the complaint.\"\n\n4. Because his Honor erred, for the reason therein stated, in refusing defendant's motion for the direction of a verdict upon the following ground:\n\n\"(2) Because the entire evidence admits only of the inference that no threats or warnings were made to or against the plaintiff by any duly authorized agent of the defendant, for whose action the defendant is legally responsible.\"\n\n5. Because his Honor erred, for the reasons therein stated, in refusing defendant's motion for the direction of a verdict upon the following ground:\n\n\"(3) Because, under the decision of the Supreme Court, there is no evidence that the defendant threatened to destroy plaintiff's business, and in pursuance of that threat, falsely and maliciously made the publication in its paper, and, in the absence of such evidence, the Court must rule as a matter of law that the publications are not libelous.\"\n\n6. Because his Honor erred, for the reasons therein stated, in refusing defendant's motion for the direction of a verdict upon the following ground:\n\n\"(4) Because the entire testimony shows that all of the facts or acts charged to plaintiff, in the publications referred to, were true and the comments or criticisms made by the defendant upon these acts or facts are not libelous, being merely criticisms upon the public acts of plaintiff, in which the general public were interested.\"\n\n7. Because his Honor erred, for the reasons therein stated, in refusing defendant's motion for the direction of a verdict upon the following ground:\n\n\"(5) Because there is no allegation or evidence that the publications had any reference to or effect upon the plaintiff's business.\"\n\n8. Because his Honor erred, for the reasons therein stated, in refusing defendant's motion for the direction of a verdict upon the following ground:\n\n\"(6) Because upon the uncontradicted evidence the publications were privileged and there is no evidence of any express or actual malice to overcome the privilege.\"\n\n9. Because his Honor erred in charging the jury as follows, to wit:\n\n\"You will notice that in the definition of libel that I charged you it starts off with `malicious defamation;' therefore, you will note that you must understand what malicious or malice is. You have an idea in everyday common affairs what malice means, but the broad legal sense of the word is the wilful or intentional doing of a wrongful act without just cause or excuse. I copied one of the definitions, had\nan opportunity to copy one of the definitions of malice from a law book: `The term malice in its broad sense imports that state of mind or feeling which prompts an individual to do an act whereby another is or may be injured wrongfully and intentionally, without just cause or excuse.'\"\n\nThe error being:\n\na. That the only question of malice that the jury had to pass upon was the existence of actual malice or malice in fact (as distinguished from what is known as legal malice or malice in law) to rebut the defense of privilege communication, and his Honor, therefore, instructed the jury that the existence of legal malice would rebut the privileged communication, whereas, although legal malice is inferred in law from a libelous publication, yet there must be actual malice to overcome a privileged occasion or privileged publication.\n\nb. This charge was inconsistent with the defendant's sixth request, which was subsequently charged, and which required plaintiff to prove that the defendant was actuated by malice in fact, as contrasted with malice in law, if the jury should find that the publications were privileged.\n\n10. Because his Honor erred in charging the jury as follows, to wit:\n\n\"I charge you further that the acts, all acts of the agent, whether within the scope of his authority or not at the time, if his acts are ratified subsequently by the principal, then the principal makes those acts the acts of themselves or itself.\"\n\nThe error being that there was no allegation or evidence that the acts of the agent in this case were subsequently ratified by the defendant principal, and it was error to instruct the jury that they could so find.\n\n11. Because his Honor erred in charging the plaintiff's first request, as follows, to wit:\n\n\"`If the jury find that the written words in this case tends to diminish the respectability of the plaintiff to whom\nthey relate and to expose him to disgrace and obloquy, although they do not impute the commission of a crime, they are libelous and actionable, although no special damages are alleged or proven.'\n\n\"I charge you that, gentlemen, in connection with what I have already charged you along the line that the plaintiff must establish by the preponderance of the evidence that the defamatory publication was of or concerning him.\"\n\nThe error being:\n\na. That his Honor thereby excluded the defendant's defense of privileged communication, and\n\nb. That his Honor thereby excluded the defendant's defense that the publications were true, and\n\nc. That said charge was erroneous under the decision of the Supreme Court in this cause because it did not require plaintiff to establish that the defendant had made prior threats to write up plaintiff and destroy his business, and that the publications were subsequently made pursuant to such threats and were maliciously false and intended and actually did result injuriously to plaintiff.\n\nd. This was absolutely inconsistent with defendant's request 3a, which was subsequently charged and so misled and confused the jury.\n\n12. Because his Honor erred in charging the plaintiff's fourth request, as follows:\n\n\"4. I charge you that if you believe from the evidence that the publications attributed to the defendant were published with relation to the plaintiff, and if you further believe that said publications were libelous &#8212; that is, that they tended to diminish the respectability of the plaintiff and to expose him to disgrace and obloquy, although they did not impute the commission of a crime, then your verdict should be for the plaintiff.\"\n\n\"I charge you that, gentlemen, modified by what I have already charged you and what I will charge you hereafter from the requests of the defendant.\"\n\nThe error being:\n\na. That his Honor thereby excluded the defendant's defense of privileged communication, and\n\nb. That his Honor thereby excluded the defendant's defense that the publications were true, and\n\nc. That said charge was erroneous under the decision of the Supreme Court in this cause because it did not require plaintiff to establish that the defendant had made prior threats to write up plaintiff and destroy his business, and that the publications were subsequently made pursuant to such threats and were maliciously false and intended and actually did result injuriously to plaintiff.\n\nd. This was absolutely inconsistent with defendant's request 3a, which was subsequently charged, and so misled and confused the jury.\n\n13. Because his Honor erred in charging plaintiff's fifth request, as follows:\n\n\"5. I charge you that `in a legal sense, malice, as an ingredient of actions for slander or libel, signifies nothing more than a wrongful act, done intentionally, without just cause or excuse.'\"\n\n\"I charge you that.\"\n\nThe error being:\n\na. That the jury had nothing to do with the question of \"malice\" in a legal sense, since if the publications were libelous, the law infers that they were made maliciously, and the only question of malice for the jury was whether there was express malice or malice in fact, which would rebut or overcome the defense of privileged communication, which means personal anger, personal malice, or personal ill will, spite or hatred, and the charge was, therefore, erroneous.\n\nb. That this was inconsistent with the defendant's sixth request, subsequently charged, and which gave the true and correct definition of malice with which the jury was concerned, and, therefore, misled and confused the jury, so that it could not determine what character of malice would\nrebut or overcome the defense of privileged communications, and allowed them to conclude that malice in a legal sense would do this.\n\n14. Because his Honor erred in charging the plaintiff's sixth request, as follows:\n\n\"6. If the jury find that the plaintiff was threatened by the defendant, and warned that defendant would write him up in The State newspaper and ruin his business, and in pursuance of that threat did attack the plaintiff and the attack was malicious and untrue or exceeded the limits of fair criticism in the discussion of public affairs and the plaintiff unjustly exposed to obloquy and disgrace, then the verdict must be for the plaintiff.\"\n\n\"I charge you that, gentlemen.\"\n\nThe error being that this deprived the defendant of its defense that the publications were true, in that he therein charged that the verdict must be for the plaintiff if the publications exceeded the limits of fair criticism in the discussion of public affairs and the plaintiff was unjustly exposed to obloquy and disgrace, whereas, the truth of the publications was a complete defense.\n\n15. Because his Honor erred in charging plaintiff's eighth request, as follows, to wit:\n\n\"`8. I charge you that fair and honest criticism in matters of public concern is privileged, but the privilege is limited strictly to comments and criticism and does not extend to protect false statements, unjust inferences, imputation of evil motives or criminal conduct and attacks upon private character, the publisher being responsible for the truth of what he alleges to be facts.'\n\n\"I charge you that, gentlemen, modified, of course, and qualified by what I have already charged you and what I will charge you.\"\n\nThe error being that his Honor therein confused the question of privileged communication or privileged occasion with the question as to whether or not a publication is libelous\nor not libelous, and erred in charging the jury that the privilege \"does not extend to protect false statements, unjust inferences, imputation of evil motives or criminal conduct and attacks upon private character, the publisher being responsible for the truth of what he alleges to be facts,\" whereas, a privileged communication does furnish a defense, even to such a publication, and even though such a publication would be libelous and actionable but for the privilege, and his Honor thereby misled the jury.\n\n16. Because his Honor erred in charging the plaintiff's eleventh request, to wit:\n\n\"11. If you find under the law and the facts in this case that the plaintiff is entitled to recover damages, in addition to any actual damages which may have been proven, you may give what in law is known as exemplary or punitive damages &#8212; that is, damages that may be a punishment to the defendant and an example to others.\n\n\"I charge you that, gentlemen.\"\n\nThe error being:\n\na. That this authorized the jury to award exemplary or punitive damages, even though they did not find from the preponderance of the testimony that the action of the defendant was reckless, wilful, wanton or malicious.\n\nb. That this was a charge on the facts in violation of article V, section 26 of the Constitution, in that it indicated his Honor's opinion that plaintiff was entitled to punitive damages, in the event of a recovery, when this issue was for the sound discretion of the jury.\n\nc. That punitive damages are not recoverable in this action.\n\nd. That it allowed the jury to find punitive damages in the absence of express malice.\n\n17. Because his Honor erred in charging the jury as follows, to wit:\n\n\"Just here, gentlemen, I desire to take up one of the requests of the defendant out of order; and before I read\nthat request I instruct you that privileged communications are matters for the jury after the Court has instructed you what privileged communications are under the law. In other words, you are to decide whether or not the communications or publications complained of were privileged. And for your guidance I charge you this seventh request of the defendant.\"\n\nThe error being that the question of whether or not the communications were privileged or made on privileged occasion, was entirely and exclusively for the Court, and his Honor should have charged the jury, under the entire evidence, that the publications in question were made on a privileged occasion and were privileged communications.\n\n18. Because his Honor erred in refusing defendant's request 2b, which was as follows, to wit:\n\n\"2b. Because of the occasion and the manner in which these publications were made, I charge you that they were privileged communications and, as I will hereafter charge you, even though they were libelous, the publications being privileged, the defendant is not liable, unless they were accompanied or caused by express or actual malice, as I shall hereafter define to you.\"\n\nThe error being that this was a correct proposition of law, applicable to the issues made by the pleadings and testimony and defendant was entitled to have the same charged.\n\n19. Because his Honor erred in refusing defendant's request 3b, which was as follows:\n\n\"3b. And before the jury can conclude that the publications were libelous they must find that they were intended or understood to reflect upon or relate to plaintiff's business or occupation and that they actually did affect plaintiff's business injuriously.\"\n\nThe error being that this was a correct proposition of law, applicable to the issues made by the pleadings and testimony, and should have been charged.\n\n20. Because his Honor erred in refusing defendant's request 4c, which was as follows:\n\n\"4c. The ordeal of public scrutiny is many times a disagreeable and painful operation. But it is the result of that freedom of speech which is the necessary attribute of every free government, and is expressly guaranteed to the people of this country by the Constitution. The same may be said of the freedom of the speech as of the press: `That among those principles deemed sacred in America; among those sacred rights considered as forming the bulwark of their liberty, which the government contemplates with awful reverence, and would approach with the most cautious circumspection, there is no one of which the importance is more deeply impressed on the public mind. That this liberty is often carried to excess, that it sometimes degenerates into licentiousness, is seen and lamented, but the remedy has not yet been discovered. Perhaps it is an evil inseparable from the good with which it is allied; perhaps it is a shoot which cannot be stripped from the stalk without wounding vitally the plant from which it is torn.' \"\n\nThe error being that this was a correct proposition of law, applicable to the issues made by the pleadings and testimony, and tended to enlighten the jury on what the law means by commending a criticism of public men or men taking a part in public affairs, and tended to explain to the jury how far such fair and reasonable comment and criticism may be carried without becoming libelous, and it should, therefore, have been charged.\n\n21. Because his Honor erred in refusing defendant's fifth request, as follows:\n\n\"5. I charge you as a proposition of law, that the publications in question were qualifiedly privileged communications.\"\n\nThe error being that the entire evidence shows, as a matter of law, that the publications in question were qualifiedly privileged communications, and his Honor should have so\ninstructed the jury, instead of allowing the jury to pass upon and decide this question of law.\n\n22. Because his Honor erred in refusing defendant's ninth request, which was as follows:\n\n\"It is not alleged or proven that the publications had any relation to, or effect upon, plaintiff's business or occupation, and I charge you that they were not libelous upon the plaintiff in his business or occupation.\"\n\nThe error being that this was a correct statement of the issues made for the jury by the pleadings and testimony and his Honor should have so instructed them.\n\n23. Because his Honor erred in refusing defendant's tenth request, which was as follows:\n\n\"There is no evidence that the publications had any injurious effect upon plaintiff's business or occupation, and the jury cannot consider any damages suffered by plaintiff in business or occupation.\"\n\nThe error being that this was a correct limitation of the issues raised by the pleadings and testimony for the jury to pass upon and should have been granted.\n\n24. Because his Honor erred in refusing defendant's twelfth request, which was as follows:\n\n\"There is no evidence that the publications caused plaintiff any substantial damage in his private character or person, or that the plaintiff has been thereby exposed to public hatred, contempt, ridicule, or obloquy, or that he has been shunned, or avoided or suffered loss of society, or that his respectability has been diminished in the eyes of the public or his friends, and the jury cannot award any substantial damages for any of these elements.\"\n\nThe error being that this was a correct proposition of law, and the jury should have been so instructed.\n\n25. Because his Honor erred in refusing defendant's thirteenth request, as follows:\n\n\"13. If the jury decide that plaintiff is entitled to recover, they can award only nominal damages.\"\n\n26. Because his Honor erred in refusing defendant's sixteenth request:\n\n\"16. Even though the jury conclude that the publications were libelous, unless they further find from the preponderance of the plaintiff's testimony, that the defendant did not act in good faith under a  bona fide  belief that it was performing a moral duty owed the public and did not publish the articles in question in a  bona fide  effort to discharge such duty, but because of express or actual malice towards the plaintiff or an indirect or wrongful motive, then their verdict shall be for the defendant.\"\n\nThe error being that this was a correct proposition of law applicable to the issues raised by the pleadings and testimony and should have been granted.\n\n27. Because his Honor erred in refusing defendant's seventeenth request, which was as follows:\n\n\"17. I charge you that the only acts or facts that the three publications charge against the plaintiff are the following: That Mr. Wilson was fought at the polls by Mr. Fingal C. Black's friends, who had sprung a terrific fight upon Mr. Wilson in the last twenty-four hours, and before Mr. Wilson's friends could offset the attack, the voting was on. That brothers of Fingal C. Black were at the polls on the day of the election urging voters to cut Mr. Wilson. That there was a bitter controversy between Mr. Wilson and Mr. Fingal C. Black some time before the election, and in this controversy, Mr. Wilson was sustained by city council before whom the controversy was had. That the plaintiff, a brother of Fingal C. Black, did not make public his charges against or reasons for opposing Mr. Wilson until such a short time before the election that it was impossible for this candidate or his friends to meet, explain or counteract these charges. If the jury shall conclude that these charges of facts or acts were true in fact and that the criticisms and expressions of opinion therein contained in\nthe publications in question were made  bona fide  by the defendant in the discharge of what it conceived to be its moral duty to the public and without express or actual malice toward plaintiff or indirect or wrongful motive, then they must find for defendant.\"\n\nAnd erred in ruling thereon: \"And the seventeenth, I refuse, because, as I conceive it, to be a statement of what the meaning of the publications are, this is a matter entirely for the jury.\"\n\nThe error being that this was a correct construction of the writings before the Court, intended to intelligently place before the jury what portions of said publications were charges or allegations of fact, and what portions thereof were comment and criticism, so that the jury might intelligently decide whether the charges or allegations of fact contained in said publications were true, and whether the criticisms or expressions of opinion therein were fair and reasonable comment.\n\n28. Because, for the reasons therein stated, his Honor should have granted defendant's motion for a new trial on the minutes on its second ground:\n\n\"2. That the verdict is so greatly excessive that it shows in itself, combined with the incidents of the trial and the record thereof, that it was the result of caprice and prejudice against the defendant, and not of impartial and mature deliberation upon the testimony by the jurors.\"\n\n29. Because, for the reasons therein stated, his Honor should have granted defendant's motion for a new trial on the minutes on its third ground:\n\n\"3. That the verdict should be set aside because it is a result of political prejudice on the part of the jurors against the defendant and not of impartial and deliberate consideration of the testimony by the jurors, this appearing not only from the excessive amount of the verdict, but also from the argument of plaintiff's counsel to the jury.\"\n\n30. Because, for the reasons therein stated, his Honor should have granted the defendant's fifth ground of the motion for a new trial, which was as follows:\n\n\"5. Because his Honor having charged defendant's request 4b, as follows, to wit:\n\n\"`If the jury conclude that the publications were criticisms upon the conduct of plaintiff in a public matter &#8212; that is, expressions of opinions as to his conduct and not a defamatory charge against the plaintiff himself, then they shall find for the defendant.'\n\n\"There is a fatal variance between the charge and the inference that the publications were criticisms of the plaintiff in a public matter &#8212; that is, expressions of opinion as to his conduct and not a defamatory charge against the plaintiff himself.\"\n\n31. Because, for the reasons therein stated, his Honor should have granted defendant's motion for a new trial on its sixth ground, which was as follows:\n\n\"Because, under his Honor's charge as to what constitutes a privileged communication, the entire evidence admitted only of the inference that the publications complained of were privileged communications, and there was no evidence of actual or express malice to overcome the privilege. The verdict, therefore, is contrary to the charge as applied to the testimony.\"\n\n32. Because, for the reasons therein stated, his Honor should have granted a new trial upon defendant's seventh ground, which was as follows:\n\n\"7. Because his Honor having charged defendant's request 8 1/2, as follows, to wit:\n\n\"`The evidence should raise a probability of malice and be more consistent with its existence than its absence. When the occasion is privileged the presumption arises that the publication was  bona fide  and without malice, and it is incumbent on plaintiff to overcome this presumption. If, from defendant's point of view, strong words seem to be\njustified, he is not to be held liable unless the jury can say that what he published was to some extent, at least, inconsistent with the theory of good faith.'\n\n\"The verdict is contrary to the charge because the entire evidence admitted only of the inference that the publications were privileged and plaintiff did not sustain the burden of proof by producing any evidence of express or actual malice to overcome the privilege.\"\n\n33. Because, for the reasons therein stated, his Honor should have granted a new trial upon defendant's eighth ground, which was as follows:\n\n\"8. That his Honor having charged defendant's request 15, as follows, to wit:\n\n\"`If the jury concluded that the acts or facts charged against the plaintiff in the publications were true as charged, then they must find that the publications were not libelous, because mere criticisms and expressions of opinion upon the public acts of plaintiffs, in which the general public was interested, unless the jury go further and find from the preponderance of the plaintiff's testimony that such publications were caused or accompanied by express or actual malice, as I have heretofore defined that term to you.'\n\n\"The verdict is contrary to the charge because the evidence admits only of the inference that the acts or facts charged against the plaintiff in the publications were true as charged and plaintiff did not go further and offer evidence to show that such publications were caused or accompanied by express or actual malice.\"\n\n34. Because, for the reasons therein stated, his Honor should have granted defendant's ninth ground upon the motion for a new trial, which was as follows:\n\n\"9. Because his Honor erred in charging plaintiff's request 11, as follows, to wit:\n\n\"`If you find under the law and the facts in this case that the plaintiff is entitled to recover damages, in addition to any actual damages which may have been proven, you may\ngive what in law is known as exemplary or punitive damages &#8212; that is, damages that may be a punishment to the defendant and an example to others.'\n\n\"Under this request, the Court allowed the jury to find punitive damages even though they did not find from the preponderance of the testimony that the defendant was guilty of any wilful or malicious act or conduct, but only mere negligence.\"\n\n35. Because his Honor erred in refusing the defendant's motion for a new trial on the ground of after-discovered evidence, and in ruling thereon: \"And I do not see much difference in the statements brought forward as grounds for a new trial than was actually testified to by some witnesses.\"\n\nThe error being that there was a substantial difference between the new evidence and the evidence offered on the trial, which was material and which would have been admissible on a new trial, and which would probably have changed the result, and that such evidence was discovered after the former trial and could not have been discovered before by the use of due diligence, and for these reasons, his Honor should have granted the motion.\n\n36. Because his Honor erred in refusing defendant's motion for a new trial on the showing made that one of the jurors who rendered the verdict was influenced by passion and prejudice, whereas, he should have granted the motion and granted the new trial on the showing made.", "procedural_history": "", "scdb_id": "", "sibling_ids": [3881391], "source": "ZU", "status": "Published", "suitNature": "", "syllabus": "<p>Libel and Slander.

The question whether or not a publication was privileged as a fair and honest discussion of public affairs, or libelous, was properly submitted to the jury.</p> <p>13. A request to charge ignoring grounds for recovery, and predicating the right to recover upon only one of several grounds, properly refused.</p> <p>14. The appellant must show prejudice arising to.him from the refusal of Court to charge an abstract proposition of law quoted from former decisions of the Court.</p> <p>15.

Affirmed.Suits by Gasque, Inc., and others, representing themselves and all other druggists and drug stores in the State of South Carolina, and the South Carolina Dyers  Cleaners Association, an association composed of practically 75 per cent. of the dyers and cleaners in the State of South Carolina, too numerous to name, and others, against John W. Nates, Commissioner of Labor of the State of South Carolina, representing himself and all other law enforcement officers, to restrain enforcement of certain statutes. From an adverse decree, defendants appeal.\n\nThe decree of Judge Bellinger directed to be reported follows:\n\nThe first of the above-entitled actions was instituted in this Court by the service of summons and complaint and rule to show cause dated May 26, 1938. To the rule to show cause was attached a temporary restraining order which is still in force and effect.\n\nThe second of the above-entitled actions was similarly instituted shortly thereafter.\n\nThe defendant in each of these cases has interposed a demurrer. Since similar issues are raised in both cases, they have, for convenience, been heard together.\n\nThe facts as alleged in the  Gasque case  are that the plaintiffs in that case are employers of labor who will be affected by the provisions of Act No. 1348 of the Acts of 1938. Although the Act is referred to in the captions and pleadings in the several cases as Act No. 1348, it appears that its official permanent number is Act No. 943. It appears in the bound volume of the 1938 Acts on page 1883 and will be referred to hereinafter simply as Act No. 943.\n\nThe plaintiffs in the  Gasque case  allege that because of the peculiar character of retail drug stores and the necessity for maintaining service to the public, particularly the sale of drugs, medical, surgical and sick room necessities and supplies, it is necessary that drug stores keep open for long periods of time; that the drug stores all keep open seven days a week, most of them operating sixteen hours a day, some twenty-four hours a day, and that it is necessary to be prepared to meet emergency calls requiring delivery boys at all hours; that many of these delivery boys are under the age of eighteen years; that the delivery services must be maintained after 10 o'clock at night; that other mercantile establishments and industries exempted from the provisions of Act No. 943 are in competition with the drug stores; and that the provisions of this Act, preventing minors under the age of eighteen from working after 10 o'clock at night and preventing any person employed by a drug store, other than a prescription clerk, from working more than fifty-six hours per week, or twelve hours in any one day, are unconstitutional as applied to these plaintiffs in the various particulars set out in the complaint, and if the Act is applied to these plaintiffs it will deprive them of State and Federal constitutional rights; will destroy their business and subject them to a multiplicity of criminal prosecutions; that the plaintiffs have existing contracts with their employees under which\nthe employees now work more than fifty-six hours a week and whereby certain employees under eighteen years of age work between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.\n\nIn view of the similarity of the cases, it is unnecessary to state the facts alleged in the second of the above-entitled causes.\n\nThe defendant has interposed a demurrer to each of the complaints and by so doing, of course, under the established law of this State, has admitted all the facts set out therein, which are well pleaded, but has not, of course, admitted the allegations of unconstitutionality which are allegations of law.\n\nThe attacks upon the constitutionality of this Act may be discussed under four heads:\n\n1. Does the Act of the General Assembly providing that no employee of the manufacturing and mercantile establishments enumerated in the Act shall be permitted to work more than fifty-six hours per week, or more than twelve hours in any one day, deprive the plaintiffs of their property without due process of law or deny to them the equal protection of the law in violation of Art. 1, Section 5, of the State Constitution and of the 14th Amendment to the Federal Constitution, U.S.C.A.; does this provision impair the rights of the plaintiffs under the privileges and immunities clause (Art. 4, Section 2) of the Federal Constitution, or does this provision of the Act impair the obligation of existing contracts in violation of Art. 1, Section 8 of the Constitution of South Carolina, and Art. 1, Section 10 of the Federal Constitution?\n\n2. Do the exemptions embraced in the provisos to Section 1 of the Act constitute illegal discrimination amounting to impairment of the plaintiffs' constitutional rights under the provisions enumerated in Question 1?\n\n3. Do the Act and its title comply with the provisions of Art. 3, Section 17 of the South Carolina Constitution?\n\n4. Do the provisions of Section 2 of the Act illegally delegate to the Commissioner of Labor certain legislative and judicial functions in violation of the separation of powers provisions of the State and Federal Constitutions?\n\nIn approaching the discussion of these constitutional provisions this Court is cognizant of the principles of constitutional law so frequently reiterated by the Supreme Court of the State that every presumption of constitutionality is to be indulged in because of the high respect which the judicial branch of the government holds for its co-ordinate branch, the legislative. Unless, therefore, plaintiffs can clearly convince this Court of the unconstitutionality of the statute involved here, it must be sustained.\n\nAs was said by the United States Supreme Court in United States v. Butler ,  297 U.S. 1 ,  56 S.Ct., 312 ,  318 , 80 L.Ed., 477 , 102 A.L.R., 914: \"When an act of Congress [we supply the State Legislature] is appropriately challenged in the courts as not conforming to the constitutional mandate, the judicial branch of the government has only one duty; to lay the article of the Constitution which is invoked beside the statute which is challenged and to decide whether the latter squares with the former. All the court does, or can do, is to announce its considered judgment upon the question. The only power it has, if such it may be called, is the power of judgment. This court neither approves nor condemns any legislative policy. Its delicate and difficult office is to ascertain and declare whether the legislation is in accordance with, or in contravention of, the provisions of the Constitution; and, having done that, its duty ends.\"\n\nIt has long been recognized that the relationships between employers and employees are protected by the constitutional provisions prohibiting the impairment of contracts, the taking of life, liberty or property without due process and demanding equal protection.  Adair v. U.S. ,  208 U.S. 161 , 28 S.Ct., 277 ,  52 L.Ed., 436 , 13 Ann. Cas., 764;  Coppage .\n\nIn the  Adair case, supra , the Court said ( 208 U.S. 161 , 28 S.Ct., 280 ): \"The right of a person to sell his labor upon such terms as he deems proper is, in its essence, the same as the right of the purchaser of labor to prescribe the conditions upon which he will accept such labor from the person offering to sell. * * * In all such particulars the employer and the employee have equality of right, and any legislation that disturbs that equality is an arbitrary interference with the liberty of contract which no government can legally justify in a free land.\"\n\nThis constitutional guaranty of liberty of contract cannot, of course, be regarded as absolute in the sense that there can be no State regulation of matters as to which persons might desire to contract. There remains the State's police power which permits the Legislature to enact laws for the general good of the citizens of the State even though the incidental effect of regulation thereunder would be to deprive some individual of liberty or property. When this police power is properly exercised, the deprivation of life, liberty or property is with due process of law. Similar principles apply to the constitutional prohibition against impairment of the obligation of a contract.\n\nTo be valid as a legislative exercise of police power, the legislation must be clearly demanded for the public safety, health, peace, morals or general welfare. 11 Amr. Juris., 1171;  West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish , 300 U.S. 379 ,  57 S.Ct., 578 ,  81 L.Ed., 703 , 108 A.L. R., 1330, 11 Amr. Juris., 1001.\n\nThis brings us to a consideration of the first question raised by the pleadings:\n\n1. Does the Act of the General Assembly providing that no employee of the manufacturing and mercantile establishments enumerated in the Act shall be permitted to work more than fifty-six hours per week, or more than twelve hours in any one day, deprive the plaintiffs of their property without due process of law or deny to them the equal protection of the law in violation of Art. 1, Section 5 of the State Constitution and of the 14th Amendment to the Federal Constitution; does this provision impair the rights of the plaintiffs under the privileges and immunities clause (Art. 4, Section 2) of the Federal Constitution, or does this provision of the Act impair the obligation of existing contracts in violation of Art. 1, Section 8 of the Constitution of South Carolina, and Art. 1, Section 10 of the Federal Constitution?\n\nIt would seem clear from the authorities that in view of our modern industrial development, there are certain classes of employment and certain classes of employees with regard to which it is not only proper but necessary for the State government, in the protection of the health, morals and general welfare of the people, to legislate as to hours of labor. The maximum hour statutes which have been upheld by the Courts of our country may be grouped as follows:\n\n(1) Those statutes limiting the hours of employment of employees by states, or subdivisions thereof.  Atkin v. Kansas , 191 U.S. 207 ,  24 S.Ct., 124 ,  48 L.Ed., 148 ;  Woods v.  Woburn ,  220 Mass. 416 ,  107 N.E., 985 , Ann Cas., 1917-A, 492;  Long Island R. Co. v. Department of Labor of N.  Y. ,  138 Misc., 612 ,  247 N.Y.S., 278 .\n\n(2) Statutes limiting the hours of labor of women and minors.  Muller v. Oregon ,  208 U.S. 412 ,  28 S.Ct., 324 , 52 L.Ed., 551 , 13 Ann. Cas., 957;  Riley v. Massachusetts , 232 U.S. 671 ,  34 S.Ct., 469 ,  58 L.Ed., 788 ;  Dominion  Hotel, Inc., v. Arizona ,  249 U.S. 265 ,  39 S.Ct., 273 ,.\n\n(3) Statutes limiting the hours of labor in occupations dangerous for some especial reason to the life and health of employees.  Holden v. Hardy ,  169 U.S. 366 , 18 S.Ct., 383 ,  42 L.Ed., 780 ;  State v. Cantwell ,  179 Mo., 245 , 78 S.W., 569 .\n\n(4) Statutes limiting the hours of labor of persons in occupations where continuous employment for long hours might be dangerous to the public at large.  In re Twing , 188 Cal., 261 ,  204 P., 1082 .\n\nNeither counsel for the plaintiffs nor the Commissioner of Labor have cited to the Court any decision where any Court has ever held valid a regulation of the hours of labor of all employees within a state, or the employees of all manufacturing and mercantile establishments. The South Carolina statute before the Court purports to fix the maximum number of hours which all employees in manufacturing and mercantile establishments, with certain exceptions referred to below, may work.\n\nThe decisions set out hereinabove show that where Courts have sustained maximum hour statutes there has been some particular health motive justifying the statute. So in  Muller  v. Oregon ,  208 U.S. 412 ,  28 S.Ct., 324 ,  52 L.Ed., 551 , the Court in sustaining the maximum hour statute as to women, emphasized a woman's physical structure and the performance of maternal functions which place her at a disadvantage in the struggle for subsistence.\n\nIn certain of the other decisions, such as  Holden v. Hardy , 169 U.S. 366 ,  18 S.Ct., 383 ,  42 L.Ed., 780 , the dangerous character of the particular occupation was held to justify limiting hours.\n\nSo also in the California case of  In re Twing , 188 Cal., 261 ,  204 P., 1082 , where the Court permitted a maximum hour statute as to prescription clerks in drug stores, emphasis was put upon the importance of the public of having\nmen handling dangerous drugs protected against long hours which might make them careless in such a way as to jeopardize the safety of the public.\n\nThere are numbers of cases where the Courts have refused to sustain general maximum hour statutes. Perhaps the leading case is  Lochner v. People of New York ,  198 U.S. 45 , 25 S.Ct., 539 ,  544 ,  49 L.Ed., 937 , 3 Ann. Cas., 113, in which the Court held unconstitutional a New York statute limiting employment in bakeries to sixty hours a week and ten hours a day. There the Court said: \"The trade of a baker, in and of itself, is not an unhealthy one to that degree which would authorize the legislature to interfere with the right to labor, and with the right of free contract on the part of the individual, either as employer or employee. * * * Statutes of the nature of that under review, limiting the hours in which grown and intelligent men may labor to learn their living, are no more than meddlesome interferences with the rights of the individual, and they are not saved from condemnation by the claim that they are passed in the exercise of the police power and upon the subject of the health of the individual whose rights are interfered with, unless there be some fair ground reasonable in and of itself, to say that there is material danger to the public health, or to the health of the employees, if the hours of labor are not curtailed.\"\n\nIn  State v. Henry , 37 N. Mex., 536,  25 P.2d 204 ,  208 , 90 A.L.R., 805, the statute prohibited the working of male employees in mercantile establishments more than eight hours a day, or forty-eight hours in a week of six days. The Court, after fully reviewing the authorities, said: \"The statute before us bears no evidence of a legislative purpose by it to safeguard health, morals, or safety. No claims are here made that it was so intended or will so result. Facts of which we may take judicial notice, and none other are before us, do not argue, and we are unable to conclude, that the health, morals, or safety of the general public or of the class regulated\nare at all involved in the sustaining or the overthrow of the act; or that there is involved any other specific object for which we have become accustomed to some yielding of the principles of personal liberty and of private property.\"\n\nMany other Courts have similarly held that the general regulation of the hours of labor in private industry in which the Court can see no direct relation to the public health, welfare or morals, is not a proper exercise of the police power and must be held invalid as in violation of the constitutional protection of the individual.  United States v. Northern Commercial  Co. ,  6 Alaska, 94 ;  State v. Barba ,  132 La., 768 , 61 So., 784 , 45 L.R.A. (N.S.), 546, Ann. Cas., 1914-D, 1261, State v. Legendre ,  138 La., 154 ,  70 So., 70 , L.R.A., 1916-B, 1270;  Commonwealth v. Boston  M.R.R. , 222 Mass. 206 ,  110 N.E., 264 ;  State v. Pocock , 161 Minn., 376 ,  201 N.W., 610 ;  State v. Mikiscek ,  225 Mo., 561 , 125 S.W., 507 , 135 Am. St. Rep., 597;  Low v. Rees Printing  Co. ,  41 Neb. 127 ,  59 N.W., 362 , 24 L.R.A., 702, 43 Am. St. Rep., 670.\n\nSomething was said in argument about sustaining the statute as an exercise of the extraordinary powers of government in times of an emergency and as a method of combating unemployment. There is nothing in the nature of the Act which would lead a Court to believe that it would have any substantial effect on unemployment. As a matter of fact, it might, as said by the Court in the  Henry  case , have an adverse effect on increasing employment.\n\nIt is also worthy of note that there are no recitations in this Act indicating that it was passed upon any theory that work for more than fifty-six hours in any week was injurious to the health or dangerous to the life of the employees. Nor is there anything in the Act indicating a purpose to relieve unemployment. Nor is there anything showing a purpose to protect the public from any evil results of longer hours of work.\n\nThe Court cannot conclude that it is dangerous to the health or safety of the employees or the public for an employee to work more than fifty-six hours in any one week in all of the manufacturing and mercantile establishments covered by the terms of the Act. On this first question, therefore, the Court must conclude that the Act violates the due process, equal protection and contract clauses of both State and Federal Constitutions, in that it is not a proper exercise of the public power of the State.\n\n2. Do the exemptions embraced in the provisos to Section 1 of the Act constitute illegal discrimination amounting to impairment of the plaintiff's constitutional rights under the provisions enumerated in Question 1?\n\nThe Legislature has under the provisos in Section 1 of the Act exempted from its provisions a large number of manufacturing and mercantile establishments. The 14th Amendment to the Federal Constitution, Article 1, Section 5 of the State Constitution, and Article 4, Section 2, of the Federal Constitution, protect mercantile and manufacturing establishments which come within the provisions of this Act against discrimination in favor of other mercantile and manufacturing establishments expressly exempted from the operation of the Act.\n\nIt is true that the Legislature has the power in passing a law to make a classification of its citizens and the constitutional provisions are not violated by such classification if the law as passed is applicable alike to all persons belonging to the given class, but the Courts of the State and of the United States have always held that such classification cannot be made arbitrarily, but must rest upon some difference which bears a reasonable and just relation to the Act in which the classification was proposed.  Sirrine  v. State ,  132 S.C. 241 ,  128 S.E., 172 ;  Standard Oil Co.  v. City of Spartanburg ,  66 S.C. 37 ,  44 S.E., 377 ;  City of  Laurens v. Anderson ,  75 S.C. 62 ,  55 S.E., 136 , 117 Am. St. Rep., 885, 9 Ann. Cas., 1003;  Wingfield v. South Carolina .\n\nIn  Colgate v. Harvey, supra , the United States Supreme Court said ( 296 U.S. 404 ,  56 S.Ct., 256 ): \"But the classification `must be reasonable, not arbitrary, and must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike.' * * * The classification, in order to avoid the constitutional prohibition, must be founded upon pertinent and real differences, as distinguished from irrelevant and artificial ones. The test to be applied in such cases as the present one is: Does the statute arbitrarily and without genuine reason impose a burden upon one group of taxpayers from which it exempts another group, both of them occupying substantially the same relation toward the subject-matter of the legislation? `Mere difference is not enough.'\"\n\nIt would be useless to quote at length from the other United States Supreme Court decisions referred to above and the many others which state and apply this rule, because the language of each is almost identical.\n\nIn our own case of  Sirrine v. State, supra  ( 132 S.C. 241 , 128 S.E., 175 ), the Court thus quotes with approval from the case of  State v. Garbroski ,  111 Iowa, 496 , 82 N.W., 959 , 56 L.R.A., 570, 82 Am. St. Rep., 524: \"Equality in right, privilege, burdens and protection is the thought running through the Constitution and laws of the State; and an act intentionally and necessarily creating inequality\ntherein, based on no reason suggested by necessity or difference in condition or circumstances, is opposed to the spirit of free government, and expressly prohibited by the Constitution.\"\n\nAnd accepts also with approval the following statement of the law from a note by Mr. Freeman in 93 Am. St. Rep., 111: \"A law is not constitutional if it confers particular privileges, or imposes peculiar disabilities or burdensome conditions in the exercise of a common right upon a class of persons arbitrarily selected from the general body of those that stand in the same relation to the subject of the law. The Legislature may classify, for the purpose of legislation, if some intrinsic reason exists why the law should operate upon some and not upon all, or should affect some differently from others, but this classification must be based upon differences which are either defined by the Constitution, or are natural or intrinsic, and which suggest a reason that may rationally be held to justify the diversity in the legislation. It must not be arbitrary, for the mere purpose of classification. The clause must be characterized by some substantial qualities or attributes, which render such legislation necessary or appropriate for the individuals of the class.\"\n\nIt is also true that the right of the Legislature to classify is much broader in the field of taxation than it is in criminal statutes such as this. Particularly pertinent is the decision of our Court in  Ex parte Hollman , 79 S.C. 9 ,  60 S.E., 19 ,  25 ,  21  L.R.A. (N.S.), 242, 4 Ann. Cas., 1105, where the Court quotes from the United States Supreme Court decision of  Connolly v. Pipe Co. , 184 U.S. 540 ,  22 S.Ct., 431 ,  46 L.Ed., 679 : \"In prescribing regulations for the conduct of trade, it cannot divide those engaged in trade into classes and make criminals of one class, if they do certain forbidden things, while allowing another and favored class, engaged in the same domestic trade, to do the same things with impunity. It is one\nthing to exert the power of taxation so as to meet the expenses of government, and at the same time indirectly, to build up or protect particular interests or industries.  It is  quite a different thing for the state under its general police  power to enter the domain of trade or commerce, and discriminate  against some by declaring that particular classes  within its jurisdiction shall be exempt from the operation  of a general statute, making it criminal to do certain things  connected with domestic trade or commerce.  Such a statute is not a legitimate exertion of the power of classification, rests upon no reasonable basis, is purely arbitrary, and plainly denies the equal protection of the laws to those against whom it discriminates.\" (Italics supplied by South Carolina Supreme Court.)\n\nSo we note that the South Carolina Supreme Court has refused to sustain a statute providing that Confederate veterans should be exempted from licenses for carrying on business within the State ( City of Laurens v. Anderson ,  75 S.C. 62 , 55 S.E., 136 , 117 Am. St. Rep., 885, 9 Ann. Cas., 1003); has refused to sustain a statute requiring that dealers in oil be licensed and exempting from this requirement dealers handling oil on which a license had already been paid ( Standard Oil Co. v. City of Spartanburg ,  66 S.C. 37 , 44 S.E., 377 ); and has held invalid a statute allowing the confiscation of goods exposed for sale on Sunday when owned by a corporation.  Xepapas v. Richardson ,  149 S.C. 52 , 146 S.E., 686 . The distinction which this Court reaches from these decisions, as well as from the encyclopedias (12 Am. Juris., 151, 156), is that the classification must be based upon a real difference which bears a fair, natural and reasonable relation to the object of the legislation and must not be arbitrary and baseless.\n\nComing now to an examination of the Act, it will be found helpful to list in parallel columns businesses exempted and those regulated:\n\n \n    Businesses Exempted                     Businesses Regulated \n\nHotels                                Boarding houses\n                                      Tourist camps\n                                      Y.M.C.A.s and Y.W.C.A.s\n                                      Clubs with living quarters\n                                      School dormitories\n                                      Apartment houses\n                                      Hospitals\n\nEating places connected with hotels   Independent restaurants\n                                      Lunch stands\n                                      Delicatessens\n\nOffice force and truck drivers of     Office force and truck drivers of\n  laundries                             dry cleaners\n\nSaw mills, planing mills, kaolin      Brick and tile works\n  industries                          Lumber yards\n\nCanning factories of fruits,          Canning factories of commodities\n  vegetables and other farm products    other than farm products\n\n                                      Cold storage plants\n\nCotton mills, oil mills, printing     Fertilizer plants, flour mills\n  establishments\n                                      Manufacturers of clothing, furniture\n                                        and all other manufacturing plants\n\nDairying                              Processing and packing of meat\n\nGatherers and processors of fish,     Sale and delivery of milk and milk\n  shrimp and oysters                    products\n                                      Soft drink bottlers\n                                      Distribution and sale of soft drinks\n                                      Bakers\n                                      Processing of tobacco\n\nGold mining                           Mining other than gold and kaolin\n\nRetail liquor stores                  Wholesale liquor stores.

There can be no logical distinction between the work of a waitress in an eating place connected with a hotel and her work in an independent restaurant. There would seem to be no reason why a truck driver for a laundry should be exempt, while a truck driver for a dry cleaning plant should be regulated. There would seem to be no reason why brick and tile works should be regulated and employees of saw mills, turpentine plants and logging industries should be exempt. Cotton gins and oil mills are not as healthful places of employment as book stores or filling stations, yet the gins and oil mills are exempt while the book stores and filling stations are regulated.\n\nComparisons might be multiplied end upon end. But having in mind that the object of the Act must necessarily be the protection of the health, morals or safety of the general public and employees, the Court cannot say that the industries included within the provisions of the Act are of such a character as to justify the Legislature in saying that work in these industries for more than fifty-six hours per week jeopardizes the health of the employee, while work for more than fifty-six hours in the exempted businesses does not.\n\nIt is also to be noted that the effect of this Act would be to place certain of the regulated mercantile establishments and industries at a competitive disadvantage\nwith certain of those exempted. For instance, eating places connected with hotels, whether dining rooms, cafes, coffee shops, lunch stands or tea rooms, are exempted, while restaurants, drug stores selling light lunches, independent coffee shops and tea rooms are included. Under a 1938 statute retail liquor stores which are exempted from the provisions of the Act are in competition as to certain wines with drug stores, which are included in the Act. Saw mills exempted from the Act are in competition as to building materials with brick and tile works, which are regulated by the Act.\n\nMany decisions from various states ( United States v.  Northern Commercial Co. ,  6 Alaska, 94 ;  State v. Le Barron , 24 Wyo., 519 ,  162 P., 265 , Ann Cas., 1918-D, 998;  Low  v. Rees Printing Co. ,  41 Neb. 127 ,  59 N.W., 362 , 24 L.R.A., 702, 43 Am. St. Rep., 670;  State v. Barba , 132 La., 768 ,  61 So., 784 , 45 L.R.A. (N.S.), 546, Ann. Cas., 1914-D, 1261;  State v. Legendre ,  138 La., 154 ,  70 So., 70 , L.R.A., 1916-B, 1270;  State v. Henry , 37 N. Mex., 536, 25 P.2d 204 , 90 A.L.R., 805;  State v. Pocock , 161 Minn., 376 ,  201 N.W., 610 ) have held that this illegal discrimination in maximum hour legislation requires a holding that the Act is unconstitutional. In many of these cases the exemptions were nothing like as flagrant as those before the Court. For instance, in  Low v. Rees Printing Co., supra , an exemption as to laborers engaged in farm or domestic work was held sufficient by the Nebraska Court to require the voiding of the Act because of discrimination.\n\nThe Minnesota Court in the case of  State v. Pocock,  supra , held there was illegal discrimination where the Act purported to exempt employees in places of amusement, newspaper plants, canneries, flour mills and automobile repair shops.\n\nThe Wyoming Court in  State v. Le Barron, supra , struck down a maximum hour Act with regard to the employment of women in restaurants because it exempted from its provisions\n\"hotels and restaurants operated by railroad companies.\"\n\nAnother discrimination hostile to the constitutional provisions is found in the proviso that the terms of the Act should not apply to restaurants and public eating places in towns, villages and communities of less than 3,000 population, should not apply to mercantile establishments in towns of less than 2,500 population, or to manufacturing and mercantile establishments in rural areas. There would seem to be no justification for this distinction. Work for more than fifty-six hours in a manufacturing plant in a rural area is no less injurious than work for the same period of time in a manufacturing plant in a city. An employee in a shoe store in Barnwell should not be permitted to work longer than an employee in a shoe store in Charleston. Under the Act a waitress in an air-conditioned restaurant in Columbia may work only fifty-six hours a week but the waitress in a barbecue stand in a community of less than 3,000 people may work as long as she contracts.\n\nThese distinctions do not comply with the constitutional requirements. The Court is of opinion that the Act is fatally defective by reason of the unconstitutional discriminations contained therein.\n\nCounsel for the defendant, recognizing the seriousness of the discriminatory features of the attacked Act, have suggested that the Court might strike out the provisos contained in Section 1, and hold the remaining portion of the Act valid because of the saving clause contained in Section 7 of the Act. The purpose of a proviso clause in an Act has thus been discussed by our Court:\n\nFrom  State ex rel. Walker v. Sawyer ,  104 S.C. 342 , 88 S.E., 894 ,  895 : \"The words `provided that' are usually used to express a condition, limitation, or exception. Perhaps, no words more apt for that purpose could be chosen. But they are not always so used; and their meaning must be gathered from the context and a consideration of the whole instrument.\"\n\nFrom  Shealy v. Seaboard Air Line R. Co. ,  131 S.C. 144 , 126 S.E., 622 ,  626 : \"`The office of a proviso is either to except something from the enacting clause or to qualify or restrain its generality, or to exclude some ground of misinterpretation of it.' 25 R.C.L., &#167; 231, p. 984. The main provision of a statute and the proviso are to be read together with a view to carry into effect the whole purpose of the law.\"\n\nWere this Court to strike out the provisos in Section 1 of the Act it would clearly contravene the intention of the Legislature because the effect of such an order would be to subject to the fifty-six hour bill all of the industries expressly exempted by the terms of the Act and would subject all mercantile and manufacturing establishments in rural areas, towns and communities of less than 2,500 people, although the Legislature expressly said that the Act was not to apply to those areas.\n\nIn other words, by striking out the provisos the Act would become a general Act relating to hours of labor in all manufacturing and mercantile establishments in the State. The body of the Act, as clearly shown by Section 1 as passed by the Legislature, did not intend to regulate the hours of labor in all manufacturing and all mercantile establishments in all parts of the State. Therefore, if the Court followed the suggestion of counsel for the State, the Court would be legislating, which is exclusively the province of the General Assembly. This statute is one that cannot be saved by striking down a portion of the Act despite the provisions of Section 7.\n\n3. Do the Act and its title comply with the provisions of Article 3, Section 17 of the South Carolina Constitution?\n\nIt is the contention of the plaintiffs that the subject of the statute is the regulation of hours of labor in certain  manufacturing and mercantile establishments of the State and since the title indicates a regulation of hours of labor in  all  manufacturing and mercantile establishments, there is an antagonism between the body of the Act and the\ntitle which violates Section 17 of Article 3 of the State Constitution. That section requires that: \"Every Act or resolution having the force of law shall relate to but one subject, and that shall be expressed in the title.\"\n\nThis section of the Constitution has been before our Supreme Court in many cases, and has been generally construed with great liberality, the Court never requiring the title to be an index to the Act, but holding that the Constitution is complied with when the title expresses the general subject of legislation and the provisions in the body of the Act are germane thereto as means to accomplish the object expressed in the title.  Arthur v. Johnston et al. ,  185 S.C. 324 , 194 S.E., 151 ;  Crawford v. Johnston ,  177 S.C. 399 , 181 S.E., 476 ;  Plowden v. Beattie ,  185 S.C. 229 , 193 S.E., 651 .\n\nIn the present case the title indicates that the purpose and subject-matter of the statute is the regulation of hours of labor. Nothing in the body of the Act goes beyond that subject.\n\nThe cases cited by the plaintiffs,  State ex rel. Ray v.  Blease ,  95 S.C. 403 ,  79 S.E., 247 , and  Robinson v. City  of Columbia ,  116 S.C. 193 ,  107 S.E., 476 , are both cases in which the body of the Act was broader than the title, and, therefore a party whose rights were actually affected by the terms of the body of the Act might have no notice of the application of the Act to himself by reading the title. In the present case the objection is the converse, that the subject-matter of the Act as expressed in the title is broader than the terms of the Act itself. The reason behind the rule of the cases cited by plaintiffs, therefore, is inapplicable here and this Court is constrained to hold that the broad subject of the legislation is so expressed in the title of the Act as to satisfy the constitutional mandate.\n\nThe final question before the Court is: 4. Do the provisions of Section 2 of the Act illegally delegate to the Commissioner of Labor certain legislative and judicial functions\nin violation of the separation of powers provisions of the State and Federal Constitutions?\n\nThe Act is challenged by the plaintiffs as containing illegal delegation because in Section 2(b) the power is conferred upon the Commissioner of Labor to dispense with the requirement as to posting the schedule of hours of employment weekly in advance when the Commissioner is satisfied by evidence that the character of the work is of such a nature as to make it difficult to fix the hours of employment in advance; and in Section 2 (c) to grant an employer, upon application and proof of necessity, permission to work his employees more than fifty-six hours per week during a period not to exceed thirty days in any calendar year.\n\nIt is the opinion of the Court that these are matters of an administrative nature rather than of a judicial or legislative nature. It has been consistently held by our Supreme Court that when an Act is complete on its face no unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority can be imputed to it by the fact that authority or discretion as to its execution is vested in an administrative officer, commission or board.  State ex rel. Richards v. Moorer , 152 S.C. 455 ,  150 S.E., 269 ;  Crawford v. Johnston ,  177 S.C. 399 , 181 S.E., 476 ;  Santee Mills v. Query ,  122 S.C. 158 , 115 S.E., 202 ;  State ex rel. Port Royal Mining  Co. v. Hagood ,  30 S.C. 519 ,  9 S.E., 686 , 3 L.R.A., 841, Stovall et al. v. Sawyer, Chief Highway Com'r. ,  181 S.C. 379 , 187 S.E., 821 ;  Bramlette v. Stringer ,  186 S.C. 134 , 195 S.E., 257 ;  State v. Ross ,  185 S.C. 472 , 194 S.E., 439 ;  Fisher v. J.H. Sheridan Co. ,  182 S.C. 316 , 189 S.E., 356 , 108 A.L.R., 981.\n\nThe rule is thus expressed in the case of  State ex rel.  Richards v. Moorer, supra  ( 152 S.C. 455 ,  150 S.E., 273 ): \"There is a distinction, however, between delegating power to make a law and conferring authority or discretion as to its execution. If a legislative act is clothed with all the forms of law and is complete in itself in form and substance, if the officer, board, or commission to whom the authority is alleged\nto have been delegated is given no power to add to or take away from the law as enacted, if nothing is left to discretion as to what shall constitute the form and substance of the statute, and if the act embodies a full and complete expression of the legislative will, matters which may be fairly regarded as relating to the administration and execution of the statute, even though involving discretion, do not constitute an unauthorized delegation of legislative authority.\"\n\nFrom  Stovall et al. v. Sawyer, Chief Highway Com'r,  supra  ( 181 S.C. 379 ,  187 S.E., 824 ):\n\n\"The legislature cannot delegate its power to make a law; but it can make a law to delegate a power to determine some fact or state of things upon which the law makes, or intends to make, its own action depend. * * *\n\n\"It has been held that the law-making body has authority to exercise its police powers by general laws, and to confer upon boards and other agencies authority and discretion to execute these laws, giving to such agencies the power to prescribe rules and impose penalties for their violation.\"\n\nFrom the case of  State v. Ross, supra  ( 185 S.C. 472 , 194 S.E., 441 ): \"The court in the authority just cited set forth, approved, and adopted the view as stated in Locke's Appeal,  72 Pa., 491 , 13 Am. Rep., 716, as follows: `Then, the true distinction, I conceive, is this: The legislature cannot delegate its power to make a law; but it can make a law to delegate a power to determine some fact or state of things upon which the law makes, or intends to make, its own action depend. To deny this would be to stop the wheels of government. There are many things upon which wise and useful legislation must depend, which cannot be known to the law-making power, and must, therefore, be a subject of inquiry and determination outside of the halls of legislation.'\"\n\nIn the opinion of the Court, the Act here challenged is complete on its face and leaves to the discretion of the Commissioner of Labor only the determination of facts or circumstances\nwhich the Act, by its own terms, has made its applicability conditioned upon. The Legislature has said as definitely as practicable, what facts will justify the suspending of certain requirements of the statute, and it can constitutionally leave the determination of when those facts exist to an administrative officer.\n\nAlthough, as just indicated, the so-called Hours of Labor Act would have survived plaintiffs' challenges of its validity under Article 3, Section 17 of the State Constitution and the separation of powers provisions of the State and Federal Constitutions, the Act does violate plaintiffs' more fundamental constitutional guaranties and must be declared void.\n\nThis Court is well aware of the importance of this decision to employers and employees in the State as well as to the public at large, and regrets that there has been any delay in its rendition. However, counsel for the defendant, Nates, have not furnished the Court, until the past week, a full brief of their authorities, and this fact, coupled with Court assignments outside of the circuit, has made impossible an earlier decision.\n\nThe Court is forced to the conclusion that the Act under consideration violates the several provisions of the State and Federal Constitutions as enumerated in this decree, and hesitant as the Court is to strike down an Act of the Legislature, the conclusion that the Act is unconstitutional and void is inescapable. It is therefore ordered and adjudged:\n\nThat the defendant, John W. Nates, Commissioner of Labor of the State of South Carolina, representing himself and all other law-enforcing officers who may be charged with the enforcement of the Hours of Labor Act of 1938 (No. 943), be and hereby is permanently enjoined and restrained from enforcing the provisions of this Act against the plaintiffs in each of the above-entitled actions and against other parties who are entitled to protection by reason of the representative nature of these suits, and those in favor of whom temporary restraining orders were heretofore granted at the time of the institution of these two actions.", "procedural_history": "", "scdb_id": "", "sibling_ids": [3886685], "source": "Z", "status": "Published", "suitNature": "", "syllabus": ""}
