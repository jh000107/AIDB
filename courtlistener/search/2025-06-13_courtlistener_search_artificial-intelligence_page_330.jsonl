Same. Admissibility determined by court.

Degree of proof. \u2022\u2022</p> <p>The competency of a dying declaration, whether one of fact or opinion, is a question of fact to be determined by a judicial interpretation of the meaning of the declaration, as indicated by its terms, viewed in the light of surrounding circumstances; the form of the declaration \u2014 the literal sense of the words used. \u2014 is not necessarily controlling.

There is a distinction between the source of evidence and its weig-ht.</p> <p>6. Same. Case at bar.</p> <p>The dying declaration in this case was in these words: \u201cHe [meaning the declarant] said he had been dead, and that he was going to die, and the good Lord had sent him back to tell me [the witness] that Dr. Lipscomb had poisoned him with a capsule he gave him that night, and Guy Jack had his life insured, and had hired Dr. Lipscomb to kill him. \u201d The objection to the evidence was a general one.</p> <p>Judges Whitfield' and Thompson held, even had specific objection been made, that the part of the declaration in these words, \u201cHe said . . . that Dr. Lipscomb had poisoned him with a capsule he gave him that night,\u201d was admissible, and was the statement of a fact. Judge Magbtjdeb thought the whole inadmissible, and that the part last quoted was the expression of an opinion.</p> <p>7. Pbactice. Jury's right to home papers.

When error reversible.</p> <p>Upon appeal in a criminal case, if it be found that the trial court committed error ag'ainst appellant, and that the error was calculated to and probably did produce the result evidenced by the judgment appealed from, the case should be reversed.</p> <p>Judges Magruder and Thompson thought this rule should be applied and a new trial granted, while Judge Whiteibld was of opinion that the verdict in the case was not caused, or contributed to, by the error of the court below, but was clearly proper under the law applicable to the case and the competent testimony therein, and hence that the rule had no application.</p> <p>10. Same. Motion to vacate judgment. Suggestion of error.</p> <p>Upon a motion to vacate a judgment of reversal and substitute therefor one of affirmance, on the ground that no two members of the court agree on a common ground of reversal, the question whether the original holdings of the judges were right or wrong cannot be considered; such question is proper to be raised by suggestion of error.</p>"}
