{"absolute_url": "/opinion/3553973/state-ex-rel-missouri-pacific-railroad-v-danuser/", "attorney": "Edwin J. White, Otto  Potter  and  James F. Green  for relator.\n\n(1) The Franchise Tax Law, adopted in the year 1917, is in violation of the Constitution of the State, in that the subject thereof is not clearly expressed in the title of the act. Sec. 28, Art. 4, Constitution; State v. Sloan,  258 Mo. 313 ; Williams v. Railroad,  233 Mo. 676 ; State v. Burgdoefer,  107 Mo. 19 ; State v. Coffee  Tea Co.,  171 Mo. 643 ; State ex rel. v. Hedrick, 294 Mo. 62 . (2) The Franchise Tax Act provides for a property tax and constitutes a burden on interstate commerce. Int. Paper Co. v. Mass.,  246 U.S. 135 ; Southern Gum Co. v. Laylin,  66 Ohio St. 578 ; Airway Corp. v. Day,  266 U.S. 42 . (3) Subsequent to the decision of this court in the Marquette Hotel case,  282 Mo. 213 , the General Assembly, by amendatory act, required \"the amount of liabilities\" of corporations to be reported to the State Tax Commission. Laws 1921, pp. 122, 123. The term \"surplus\" as used in the Franchise Tax Law implies that debts and liabilities should be deducted from assets, income and earnings in order to ascertain same. Fidelity Trust Co. v. Equalization Board, 71 N.J. 128 ; Green v. Eq. Ins. Co.,  169 N.Y. 19 ; Bank of Commerce v. Tennessee,  161 U.S. 134 ; People v. Tax Commission,  76 N.Y. 64 ; Parker v. Ins. Co.,  35 N.J.L. 575 .\n\n North T. Gentry,  Attorney-General, and  Walter E. Sloat, \nSpecial Assistant Attorney-General, for respondents.\n\n(1) The Franchise Tax Law is not violative of Sec. 28, Art. 4, of the Constitution of Missouri, because the subject is clearly expressed in the title of the act. The title of an act must serve as a clear and comprehensive indicator of the purpose of the act, and is sufficient if the title does not mislead as to the chief topic of the act. When it sufficiently indicates the substantial purpose of the act, it will not be violative of the Constitution, and it is only necessary that the title shall indicate the subject of it in a general way without entering into details. State ex rel. v. County Court,  128 Mo. 441 ; State v. Whitaker, 160 Mo. 59 ; State v. Sloan,  258 Mo. 313 ; State ex rel. v. Roach, 258 Mo. 559 ; Coca Cola Bottling Co. v. Mosby,  289 Mo. 472 ; State ex inf. Barrett v. Imhoff,  291 Mo. 619 ; State v. Mullinix, 301 Mo. 390 . (2) The franchise tax is not a property tax, and does not burden interstate commerce. (a) The great weight of authority is to the effect that a franchise tax is not a property tax. State v. Freehold Inv. Co., 264 S.W. 703; Southern Gum Co. v. Laylin,  66 Ohio St. 596 ; State v. Railroad Co.,  45 Md. 361 ; Phoenix Carpet Co. v. State,  118 Ala. 151 ; People ex rel. v. Knight,  174 N.Y. 478 ; People v. Insurance Co.,  92 N.Y. 344 . (b) The Franchise Tax Act is not a burden on interstate commerce, and does not become\na property tax because it is assessed on capital stock and surplus. A state may use any method it desires as a means of arriving at the basis for assessing a franchise tax. St. Louis-San Francisco Ry. Co. v. Middelkamp,  256 U.S. 231 ; Maine v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co.,  142 U.S. 228 ; Home Ins. Co. v. People, 134 U.S. 600 . (3) Subsection 14 of Sec. 9837, Laws 1921, 1 Extra Sess., page 123, which requests the amount of liabilities, was merely added to assist the Tax Commission in properly assessing the franchise tax. It cannot and does not affect the tax in any manner. (4) The franchise tax is not a property tax, hence relator is properly taxed on stock held in domestic corporations. The smaller companies owned by relator are enjoying corporate privileges, consequently, they must pay for them. The stock in other domestic corporations held by relator is carried as an asset of the corporation, and as such is taxable because it is employed in Missouri. State ex rel. Marquette Hotel v. State Tax Comm.,  282 Mo. 221 . Stocks owned by a corporation in another domestic corporation are assessable for the purpose of a franchise tax. People v. Campbell,  138 N.Y. 545 ; People ex rel. v. Knight,  174 N.Y. 475 ; People ex rel. v. Morgan,  178 N.Y. 433 . (5) The amendment to Section 9836 which exempts bank deposits from taxation under this act, has a saving clause relative to the bank section; and the act is consequently good, even though the exemption of bank deposits is not constitutional. (a) Although part of a statute may be held bad, the remainder will stand if it sufficiently shows the legislative intent. State ex rel. v. St. Louis,  241 Mo. 247 ; Simpson v. Iron Works Co.,  249 Mo. 391 ; Nally v. Home Ins. Co.,  250 Mo. 467 ; Greene County v. Lydy,  263 Mo. 87 ; State ex inf. v. Duncan,  265 Mo. 45 ; State ex rel. v. Gordon, 268 Mo. 736 ; State ex rel. v. Hackmann,  275 Mo. 543 . (6) What the term \"surplus,\" as used in the Franchise Tax Act, means, is no longer open to discussion, but is  stare decisis .

C., between 6.30 and 7.00, and not transmitted until 7.40 from Richland, there being no evidence that operator was busy with prior messages, or could not get relay station except for first five minutes after filing, or that relay stations were so occupied as not to receive and immediately transmit the message.</p> <p>5. Telegraph Company \u2014 Mental Anguish. \u2014 Evidence tending to show that plaintiff\u2019s wife remained in Lumpkin for several weeks when there were several cases of small-pox; that two towns had quarantined Lumpkin; that residents of the town could go out and in at any time on the railroad on which plaintiff\u2019s wife went in, does not show that mental anguish which the husband suffered because his wife remained in town for several, weeks subject to small-pox, was the' proximate result of failure to deliver a message advising her not to come. But the complaint is broad enough to sustain a cause of action for negligence in failing to deliver the message in time, and as a natural result the wife was exposed to small-pox from the time of her arrival until he could with reasonable diligence have removed her from the danger.</p>"}
