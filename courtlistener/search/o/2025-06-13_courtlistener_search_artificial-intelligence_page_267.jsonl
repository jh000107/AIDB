Douglas, Incorporated, and in favor of the defendant Marsh, from which the defendant company appealed.  No error. \n\nThe complaint named two defendants &#8212; Marsh, the owner of the building referred to as the \"Marsh Building,\" and H.R. Douglas, Incorporated, a concern which, under contract with Marsh, demolished and removed his building. The first of three alternative counts alleges, in substance, that the plaintiffs, as dealers in dry-goods and similar merchandise, were for a long time the occupants of certain premises on State Street in New London, under a lease with the owner, Mary L. Cady, of Brookline, Massachusetts; that Marsh had for more than a year owned the adjoining premises on the east, when, about the 1st of May, 1916, Douglas, Incorporated, began the demolition and removal of the Marsh building. The brick buildings then standing on both properties had been there for more than seventy years, and were so built and maintained that for all that period \"the westerly wall of said Marsh building and the easterly wall of said Cady building were adjacent and contiguous, the bricks on the face of the westerly wall of said Marsh building being laid up against and in contact with the bricks on the face of the easterly wall of said Cady building.\" The work of demolition continued until the Marsh building was entirely removed, the removal of its west wall being completed about June 1st, 1916. The removal of the wall was \"negligently and carelessly\" done, \"without providing any suitable or proper protection\nfor the support of\" the Cady wall \"by way of bracing or shoring the same with timbers, or in any other manner attempting to do any acts to prevent\" its collapse. The Cady wall thereafter remained \"without support or protection of any kind\" until June 20th, 1916, when it collapsed, and caused the destruction of the entire Cady building. During this period that elapsed after the last of the Marsh wall was taken away and until the collapse of the Cady building, the east wall of the latter \"was obviously in a weakened and dangerous condition,\" and having \"become, to a large extent, dependent upon the support furnished by the Marsh building,\" the removal of the Marsh wall left the Cady wall \"likely to collapse and fall unless some proper protection was given to it.\" Although all this was or should have been well known to the defendants, they not only allowed the Cady wall to remain in this unprotected condition, but \"wrongfully, carelessly and negligently made excavations\" on Marsh's property within five feet of the foundation of this Cady wall. The soil at that point was sandy \"and of such a treacherous and unsafe character that excavations made in said soil within five or six feet of the place where said soil was sustaining the great weight and pressure of supporting said easterly wall of said Cady building, would easily cause . . . said soil to shift, slip and move into said excavations, thereby removing the support afforded by said soil to the foundation of said easterly wall of said Cady building.\" While the work was in progress the plaintiffs gave notice to Marsh's architect and agent, \"who had the supervision of the work for Marsh,\" of the dangerous and weakened condition of the Cady wall, and gave notice to the same effect to H.R. Douglas, president of H. R. Douglas, Incorporated, who \"agreed with the plaintiffs to perform whatever acts might be necessary\nto properly protect and support said Cady building and to prevent said easterly wall from collapsing.\" Reasonable and proper care by Marsh for the protection of the Cady property, in planning the work upon his own, would have prevented the injuries to the plaintiffs, which were due to the method employed by the Douglas Company in carrying out the work pursuant to Marsh's instructions. The collapse of the building was \"in consequence, and as a direct result of the injurious, wrongful . . . and negligent acts of the defendants, as hereinbefore recited,\" and the plaintiffs were damaged by the destruction of their property, the interruption of their business, and the loss of the unexpired part of their lease, to an amount of more than $30,000.\n\nThe second count rests a claim for the same damages upon the substantial allegations that the Cady building as originally constructed was made to depend largely upon the support afforded it by the building which later became the property of Marsh; that this construction was with the knowledge and acquiescence of the then owners of the supporting building, and that this use of the Marsh wall had thereafter continued openly and under a claim of right for more than seventy years until the wrongful removal of the Marsh wall caused the Cady building to collapse.\n\nThe third count alleges that when the Cady building was constructed, both properties were under one ownership, and that the lateral support which the so-called Marsh building was made to furnish the Cady building became and remained a right appurtenant to the latter building. Under this count the same damages were claimed from the collapse of the Cady building by the wrongful removal of the Marsh wall in violation of this right.\n\nIssue was joined by the denial of the essential allegations\nof each count, and the answer of Marsh also averred that the position of the other defendant was that of an independent contractor.\n\nUpon a trial to the jury the plaintiffs claimed to have proved, in addition to or in support of the allegations of the complaint, these facts: When the Cady building was constructed, the common owner of that and the adjoining Marsh building remodelled the latter, and in the construction work of the former erected a 16-inch solid brick bonded wall extending along the full length of the Cady building, resting on a foundation wall of stones of such size and so laid that some of them extended under the full width of the wall. This wall, in its full width, extended up nine feet to the Cady building's second story, and above that, to the top of the easterly wall of the Cady building, it was eight inches thick. At the top of the sixteen-inch section of the wall, the sill of the Marsh building rested upon the easterly half of it; and there were inserted into it, from the foundation to the top of the sixteen-inch section, uprights which were a part of the Marsh building construction. From the second floor of the Cady building to the top, the studding of the Marsh building was in most places against the eight-inch wall of the Cady building, and four inches of brick and mortar had been placed between the studding, so as to be, for the most part, in contact with the eight-inch Cady wall. In removing this studding upon the demolition of the Marsh building, most of this brick and mortar adhered to the wall, \"so that it had to be hammered and broken away, and removed by tools.\" All of it down to the Cady building's second floor was removed after the Marsh structure had been taken down, and this work of hammering and breaking away left the Cady wall in a roughened and dangerous condition, and weakened it by thus loosening the lime and mortar between the\nbricks. The defendants took no precautions for the safety of the Cady building, \"either by shoring up the easterly wall, or otherwise.\"\n\nOne H.R. Douglas was president and manager of the Douglas Company, was in charge of its work on the Marsh property, and had full power to bind the company in relation thereto. On June 14th, 1916, the plaintiff Huber, acting also for the owner of the Cady building, had an interview with Douglas concerning the protection of the Cady building, and Douglas, as manager, agreed that the company would look out for and protect the building.\n\nAfter the removal of the Marsh structure, but before the hammering away of the brick and mortar referred to, the defendants made extensive excavations all over the Marsh property, so that the general level of their depth was below the level of the foundation stones referred to, and after permitting these excavations to remain for eighteen days in the sandy soil of the Marsh land, the defendants dug a trench two feet wide and two feet deep parallel with the wall and from three to five feet away from it. This was allowed to remain open two days during a heavy rain-fall, and its depth in some places was more than three feet below the level of the foundation wall referred to. When the building collapsed, the foundation stones supporting the sixteen-inch divisional wall moved easterly a distance of five feet into these excavations. The collapse of the Cady wall was caused by the removal of the lateral support of the soil on the Marsh property, which caused the soil under the divisional wall to move, causing the slide of the foundation stones into the excavations referred to. The manner in which the work of taking down the Marsh building and in removing the four inches of brick and mortar from its contact with the Cady wall, were unusual and dangerous, and\nordinary care was not exercised by the Douglas Company for the protection of the Cady building, while the plaintiffs were free from any negligence contributing to the collapse of the building. The divisional wall was so constructed that the dependence of that part of it on the Cady side of the line, upon the portion on the Marsh side, was apparent to ordinary observation. Neither the plaintiffs nor the nonresident owner of the Cady property were notified in advance that the Marsh building was to be removed, or that any excavations were to be made on the Marsh land, or that the division wall between the buildings was to be disturbed, and when the plaintiffs observed work in progress, the officers and agents of the Douglas Company were warned of the danger attending the work and the necessity of care and caution for the protection of the Cady building. Their attention was also called, during the work's progress, to the dangerous condition of the wall, and to the fact that the soil under the foundation of the Cady building was slipping into the excavations on the Marsh land.\n\nThe defendants claimed to have established upon the trial these facts among others: When the studding was taken down, upon the removal of the upper stories of the Marsh building, the brick and mortar between the studs came with it, and while some of it stuck to the Cady wall, it was easily removed without injury to the wall. Nothing in the appearance and construction of the Cady and Marsh buildings indicated that either was dependent upon the other for support. The construction of the Cady building was weak and defective in certain respects, and had become weakened by time in other respects, to wit: (1) the floor joists which collapsed were not anchored in the easterly wall &#8212; the effect of such anchoring being to hold the building together. (2) There was no bridging between the\nfloor joists, &#8212; the effect of bridging being to equalize the burden of support between the joists. (3) Many of the easterly ends of the floor joists were rotted &#8212; the effect being to cause them to slip out of their sockets and give an outward pressure to the wall. (4) The plank or plate on the top of the Cady wall, and the ends of rafters resting upon it, had rotted &#8212; the effect being to throw an unequal pressure from the roof upon the wall, and give the latter an outward pressure. None of these defects were known by the defendants, and could not have been discovered by ordinary inspection. the excavations upon the Marsh property in no way tended to weaken the soil or earth on the Cady property, or cause it, in its natural state, to fall or move, and the only excavation made by the defendants deeper than the bottom of the foundation wall, was a trench dug the day before the collapse of the building. The defendants did not assume to shore and protect the Cady building, and the plaintiffs neither shored nor made any attempt to shore it, and did not speak to the defendants about so doing, until June 14th, 1916.\n\nUpon the trial of the cause the plaintiffs produced in chief W. Frederick Chittenden as a witness, who, having testified upon his direct examination that he saw Mr. Douglas, the president of the Douglas Company, at the scene of the disaster on the evening of its occurrence, was asked: \"What did you say to him, and he to you, about the accident?\" The witness: \"I met Mr. Douglas there, and he came up to me very excited, and he said `My God, Mr. Chittenden, this is awful!' And I said to him, `Yes, Mr. Douglas, and you are to blame for it all. If you had trussed up our building this would never have happened.'\" The defendants' motion to strike out this answer was upon the ground that it \"is a declaration on the part of this plaintiff\nof his opinion. Now, it is claimed here as an admission. The witness himself said, `You are to blame for it.'\" The motion was denied, the court saving: \"The claim of the plaintiffs is that it is an admission by conduct. If I say to a man, `You are to blame for this,' and he says nothing, it is an admission, they say, because he says nothing. . . . I think it is admissible for what it is worth.\" An exception was noted for the defendants. In response to a further question the witness said: \"I don't think he replied to it.\"\n\nOn the redirect examination of the same witness, who was one of the plaintiffs, the following occurred: \"Q. Mr. Chittenden, why didn't you do anything to shore up or protect the inside of your building between June first, if that was the time, and the time of the accident, on the outside of the wall? A. Because Mr. Douglas assured us it was perfectly safe, or assured Mr. Huber it was perfectly safe.\" The defendants moved to strike out this answer, but the court denied the motion.\n\nThe plaintiffs produced in chief James Sweeney as a witness, who, upon his direct examination, was asked the following questions, and the following answers, discussion, and ruling were made, and the following exception taken: \"Judge Waller (for plaintiffs): I will ask you, Mr. Sweeney, first what you mean when you say that the portion of this wall had been split? Will you state what you saw, and what you mean by use of the term split? A. In splitting a wall, you separate one part from another, which leaves a very ragged surface on that face that is left. Q. What was this surface as you saw it? Describe it. A. As I say, it was a very irregular, ragged surface, with mortar and brick projecting away from the face there. Q. Now, you have said that this splitting of the wall, in your opinion, would affect the stability of the wall. I ask you if you will state in what manner such splitting of\nthe wall would affect the stability? A. The constant hammering away is bound to loosen up the mortar and brick from the mortar, and consequently the entire cohesiveness of the whole mass, and thereby endangering the stability. Q. Was there anything about the appearance of that east wall of the Cady building at the time you made this observation that in your opinion made that a dangerous situation, so far as the wall was concerned? A. Decidedly. Q. Now, will you illustrate what it was? Major Hull: Wait a minute, please. I don't recall in the pleadings any statement of acts of this kind, or any such declaration of negligence. The Court: The suggestion is that leaving the wall with this rough condition, with the bricks and mortar loosened from each other, and thereby weakened, is not set up as a specification of negligence. . . . That is not alleged as an ultimate matter, but it does seem to me admissible in evidence under the allegations of negligent removal and of leaving the wall, as the result of negligent removal, in a dangerous condition. I think it is proper. Major Hull: It seemed to me it was attempting to prove allegations not set up in the pleadings. The Court: There are many details, which have to be proved to get at the results alleged. Major Hull: I would like an exception. Q. (The last question read). A. The entire face of the wall, as I say, was very ragged. The ends of the bricks sticking out, and mortar hanging on it, on both the entire walls, here and there, and apparently had been well shaken up in the process of splitting the walls.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs produced in chief Charles Morgan Williams as a witness, who, upon his direct examination, was asked the following questions: \"Q. Now, coming back to the situation of this wall which I have described between the Marsh and Cady buildings, suppose, in taking down the Marsh building, that portion\nof the Marsh structure which rested upon and was built into the wall was removed, and the brick were removed so as to leave only eight inches of brick standing, and that was carried down to the top of the first story, the brick remaining so as to leave only eight inches standing until you got down to the top of the first story, what would be the effect of that upon the strength of the wall? A. It would weaken it. Q. Now, assuming that, in the removal of this Marsh building, the wall was taken down to the top of the first story, so as to leave standing only eight inches of the brick wall, and supposing no shoring whatever was done . . .; what would you say as to whether or not that was the usual and proper course of procedure?\" This was objected to by the defendants as calling upon the witness to state what the law, or rule, is with reference to the duties of adjoining landowners under the conditions outlined. Objection overruled. Exception. \"A. It is not. Q. Why not? A. Because it would weaken the wall. The wall would be weakened so it would be an unsafe thing to do.\"\n\nThe following interrogatories in writing were submitted to the jury, and were returned by them with the accompanying answers: &#8212;\n\n\"Interrogatories for Jury.\n\n\"If you find a plaintiffs' verdict against the Douglas Co., 1. Is the Douglas Company liable under the first count because of negligence? Answer: Yes. 2. Is the Douglas Company liable on the second count? Answer: Yes. 3. Is the Douglas Company liable on the third count? Answer: Yes.\n\n\"If you find a plaintiffs' verdict against Mr. Marsh, 4. Is Marsh liable under the first count because the Douglas Company was negligent and was his servant, and not an independent contractor? Answer: No. 5. Is Marsh liable under the first count because, although the\nDouglas Company was an independent contractor, the work was obviously dangerous? Answer: No. 6. Is Marsh liable under the second count? Answer: No. 7. Is Marsh liable under the third count? Answer: No.\n\n\"Additional Interrogatories for Jury.\n\n\"If you find a verdict for either defendant, 1. Under the first count, did the plaintiffs fail to prove that the Douglas Company's negligence was a proximate cause of the damage? Answer: No. 2. Or, did the plaintiffs fail to prove that they themselves were free from negligence which was a proximate cause of the damage? Answer: No. 3. Under the second and third counts, did the plaintiffs fail to prove that the Cady building had an easement of support by the Marsh wall? Answer: Yes. 4. Or, did the plaintiffs fail to prove that the removal of the Marsh wall caused the collapse of the Cady building? Answer: Yes.\n\n\"If you find a verdict for Marsh, 5. Under the first count, did Marsh prove his second defense that he was not responsible because he employed an independent contractor? Answer: Yes.\"\n\nThe jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendant Marsh, and for the plaintiffs to recover damages, assessed at $23,500, of the defendant H.R. Douglas, Incorporated. The court accepted both verdicts and rendered judgment upon them.\n\nThe appeal of the defendant H.R. Douglas, Incorporated, assigns error, (1) in rendering judgment on the verdicts because of the claimed contradictions in the answers to the written interrogatories; (2) in the rulings on evidence disclosed in the statement of the case; (3) in the charge to the jury; and (4) in the court's failure to charge the jury in the language of various requests.\n\nThe portions of the charge objected to are sufficiently referred to in the opinion.", "procedural_history": "", "scdb_id": "", "sibling_ids": [3322224], "source": "ZU", "status": "Published", "suitNature": "", "syllabus": ""}
