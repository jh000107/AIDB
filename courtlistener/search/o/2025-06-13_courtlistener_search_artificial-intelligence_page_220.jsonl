Keasbey, by the fourth paragraph of his last will and testament, gave the residue of his estate to his executors in trust to pay, out of the income, $10,000 yearly to his widow for life, a percentage of the income to two legatees, and:\n\n\"(e) All the balance of my said income remaining in the hands of my trustees after making the payments provided for in items b, c and d of this paragraph, I direct my executors and trustees to divide equally between my sons, Keith W. Keasbey, R. Quinton Keasbey and Aertsen P. Keasbey, until the death of my wife. In case any of my said sons should predecease my wife and leave lawful issue I direct my trustees to pay over to his children, share and share alike, his share of the income, provided they shall or any of them shall have attained the age of twenty-one years. For such grandchildren who have not attained the age of twenty-one years, I direct my said trustees to use, in their discretion, so much of the income that would belong to such deceased son or sons for the support, comfort and education of his or their children. Any unused balance of the income I direct be paid by my said trustees to the legal guardians of such children so that the grandchildren will each enjoy an equal share thereof,  per stirpes  and not  per capita.  Should any of my sons predecease his mother leaving no children but leaving a wife, I direct that my said trustees pay over one-third of such\ndeceased son's share of this balance of income to his widow so long as she remains his widow, and add the remaining two-thirds to the shares of my surviving sons.\n\n\"(f) On the death of my wife, I direct my executors and trustees to terminate the trust, and at that time, or at my death in case I survive my said wife, I dispose all of my residuary estate not heretofore disposed of, as follows:\n\n\" Fifth:  Item 1. (Annuity for Louise Pothier.)\n\n\"Item 2. (Annuity to two nephews.)\n\n\"Item 3. All the balance of my said estate, after paying the legacies and setting out the trust hereinbefore set forth, on the death of my wife, or at my death in case I survive my wife, I direct my executors to divide into four equal shares, and I direct that the amount of any indebtedness of any of my sons to me or my estate be added to the balance of my estate for the purpose of calculating the respective shares, and the amounts of such indebtedness, if any, be charged against the respective shares of my sons.\n\n\"One of such shares I direct my executors to divide into parts equal in number to the number of my grandchildren who may be living at the time this division takes place, plus one extra part for each of such grandchildren who may be a granddaughter. I direct my executors hereinafter named to set apart one such part for each grandson and two such parts for each of my granddaughters, and the several funds thus established I give, devise and bequeath to my executors hereinafter named, or their successors, in trust, however, to collect the income from each of the separate funds, and to pay the same, from time to time, after deduction of proper charges and expenses, to the guardians of my several grandchildren, until they reach the age of twenty-one years, and thereafter to the grandchildren themselves until they reach the age of twenty-five years. In case no legal guardian shall have qualified for any given one of my minor grandchildren, I authorize and empower my trustees to pay the income to either of the parents of such grandchild, or directly to such grandchild, and I direct that a receipt or quittance for funds so paid shall be a discharge  pro tanto  to my trustees. Furthermore, at the written request of the living parents or parent of any of my said grandchildren, endorsed by the grandchild, if he or she be over the age of fourteen years, I authorize my trustees to pay bills out of the principal, where the income prove insufficient, for the support, comfort or education of my several grandchildren.\n\n\"As my grandchildren shall severally reach the age of twenty-five years, I direct that the balance of the several funds, principal and income, be paid to them.
