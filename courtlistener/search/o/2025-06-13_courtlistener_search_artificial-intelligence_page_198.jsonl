Laurens, Fall Term, 1920. Affirmed.Action by W.H. Renno as Administrator of the Estate of Henry Renno, deceased, against Seaboard Air Line Railway and Walker D. Hines, Director General. Judgment for plaintiff against the Director General and he appeals.\n\nDefendant's exceptions were as follows:\n\nThe defendant, Walker D. Hines, Director General of Railroads, appeals to the Supreme Court of South Carolina from the order of his Honor, Earnest Moore, presiding Judge, in overruling his motion for a directed verdict in his favor made at the conclusion of all the testimony on the trial of this cause, and from his order refusing defendant's motion for new trial, and from the judgment entered on the verdict herein upon the following grounds of appeal and exceptions to wit:\n\n(1) Because his Honor erred in overruling the defendant's motion for a directed verdict in his favor at the conclusion of all the testimony, on the ground that no actionable negligence of the defendant had been alleged or established, and he should have so held.\n\n(2) Because his Honor erred in not holding on defendant's motion for a directed verdict at the conclusion of all the testimony that the testimony failed entirely to show that the defendant owed plaintiff's intestate any duty\nwhatsoever under the facts and circumstances of the case, and his Honor should have so held.\n\n(3) Because his Honor erred in not holding on defendant's motion to direct a verdict in his favor at the conclusion of the testimony that the entire testimony failed to show that the defendant had notice or knowledge that its right of way was made use of and resorted to by children of tender years as a place of amusement, whereas he should have so held.\n\n(4) Because his Honor erred in not holding on a directed verdict in his favor that plaintiff had failed to establish by the testimony that the defendant had created, erected, constructed, or maintained \"an attractive nuisance,\" whereas, he should have held that the doctrine or law of attractive nuisances was not applicable to the facts of this case.\n\n(5) Because his Honor erred in not holding on defendant's motion for a directed verdict in his favor at the conclusion of the testimony that the \"wash hole\" or pool of water in the branch in which plaintiff's intestate was drowned was not located on or near or in close proximity to a street, public highway, park, or other public place, and that it was not in an incorporated town or village, or in close proximity to or near by a thickly populated community, whereas he should have so held.\n\n(6) Because his Honor erred in refusing the defendant's motion for a directed verdict in his favor at the conclusion of all the testimony, on the ground that the wash hole or pool of water was located in the country, in a sparsely settled community, at a considerable distance from the corporate limits of the city of Clinton, and from the community of the Lydia Mill village, and partly within the limits of a private pasture of an adjoining landowner, in a natural water course, at some considerable distance from any public highway, street, or public place, and not immediately\nadjacent to or near by any place where children of tender years resorted for the purpose of play or amusement, whereas he should have so held.\n\n(7) Because his Honor erred in refusing defendant's motion for a directed verdict in his favor at the conclusion of all the testimony on the ground that there was no duty of the defendant to protect or safeguard its right of way at the place in question against trespassers, either adults or children, and especially as against trespassing children of sufficient age and discretion and intelligence to know and appreciate, and who did know and appreciate the danger, and that such children who know and appreciate the danger stand in identically the same position as adult trespassers, and take the premises as they find them, with all the perils and dangers, and cannot recover for any injury accruing while trespassing, or while there as licensees, whereas he should have so held.\n\n(8) Because his Honor erred in refusing defendant's motion to direct a verdict in his favor at the conclusion of the testimony, on the ground that plaintiff's intestate was a bright, active and intelligent boy of sufficient age and discretion to know of and appreciate the danger, and did know and appreciate the danger, of going in swimming in the wash hole or pool of water at the time and place in question, having been warned and cautioned against so doing, and in not being able to swim and that under such circumstances, plaintiff's intestate entered upon the defendant's right of way at his own risk, and cannot recover.\n\n(9) Because his Honor erred in overruling defendant's motion for a directed verdict in his favor at the conclusion of all the testimony, on the ground that the undisputed testimony conclusively establishes that plaintiff's intestate was a bright, active and intelligent boy who had been warned of and well knew the danger of going in swimming at the time and place in question, and therefore the only\nreasonable inference of all the testimony was and is that plaintiff's intestate was the author of his own injury, and his death was therefore directly due to his own negligence.\n\n(10) Because his Honor erred in overruling defendant's motion for a directed verdict in his favor at the conclusion of all the testimony, on the ground that the testimony shows conclusively that the cause of action is not based on any liability of the Director General of Railroads as a common carrier, and is therefore without warrant of law, the Court not having jurisdiction of the action, and his Honor should have so held.\n\n(11) Because his Honor erred in charging the jury as follows: \"Where the owner or party in possession of premises by the erection of a dam or embankment over the stream artificially converts the stream into a pool or pond, the doing of such acts, or the maintenance of such artificial pool or pond, where it was done in a populous community, and under circumstances rendering such artificial pool or pond attractive and enticing, as a dangerous place of amusement to which children of tender years in such community resorted, to the knowledge of the owner so maintaining it, such pool would constitute an attractive nuisance if the jury should so conclude from the evidence that it is maintained there, did in fact render such pool or pond dangerous as being in fact an attractive and enticing place of resort for amusement by such children, and that is was so known by the owner so maintaining it, or by the exercise of ordinary care should have been known to be such an attractive and enticing place of resort for such children. * * * But the law further declares that, where such premises are situated in close proximity to a populous community, and where the owner of such premises by the erection or maintenance of a dam or embankment, or other artificial means, makes, or maintains upon such premises an artificial construction or excavation of\nsuch character as by its existence or condition to constitute an enticement or allurement to children in general of tender years of normal characteristics in such neighborhood where the existence or maintenance of such enticement is known by such owner to be an attraction to such children generally to congregate for play or amusement upon such premises, then the existence of such children of tender years to come upon such premises and amuse themselves there.\" &#8212; the error being (a) that the jury was thereby prevented from determining that the pool or pond of water in the stream was a natural pool or pond of water, and (b) that the jury were thereby instructed in effect that the defendant would be liable to the plaintiff for the death of some if the defendant had negligently erected or maintained an embankment or fill across a natural water course, and (c) that the erection and maintenance of a culvert of insufficient size in said fill or embankment was the direct and proximate cause of the death of plaintiff's intestate, and (d) that the defendant should safeguard a pool of water in a natural watercourse if the jury should conclude that the same was dangerous to children of tender years, and (e) that his Honor thereby charged on the facts in violation of Section 26, Art. 5, of the Constitution of 1895.\n\n(12) Because his Honor erred in charging plaintiff's request to charge as follows: \"If you find from the evidence that the defendant through its agents created and maintained a fill on its right of way at the point in question, through which a natural stream of water ran, and if you further find from the evidence that the pipe or viaduct through said fill was constructed and maintained in such a manner as by its own elevation to cause and effect a hole or pool or pond to be created on its right of way in said stream immediately below said fill, if same was the proximate cause of such creation of the pool or hole, then the\npond or pool so created is an artificial pool of water, if it was so created and caused by defendant, or so maintained by the defendant by artificial means of such embankment and pipe. In other words, if the hole or pool in question was caused by artificial means put in motion by defendant, or kept in motion by defendant, then the pool in that event would constitute an artificial pool; otherwise, in the absence of proof by the greater weight of the evidence that it was caused or maintained by artificial means, a pond or pool of water in a natural running stream could not be held to be an artificial pool of water\" &#8212; the error being (a) that his Honor charged the jury that the facts which the plaintiff had alleged in his complaint, if proven, proved negligence, thereby plainly charging the jury in respect to matters of fact in violation of the provisions of Section 26, Art. 5, of the Constitution of 1895, and (b) that the alleged negligent erection and construction of the fill or embankment and the alleged culvert therein of insufficient size, was the direct and proximate cause of the death of plaintiff's intestate, and (c) that the jury was thereby prevented from considering the defendant's plea of contributory negligence of plaintiff's intestate, and (d) that his Honor thereby withdrew from the consideration of the jury the question of whether or not the pool or pond in the stream was a natural pool or pond; and (e) thereby in substance the Circuit Judge charged the jury that the defendant owed the plaintiff's intestate the duty of safeguarding or protecting a natural watercourse and pool of water, which occasionally formed therein, partly on its right of way and partly on private premises.\n\n(13) Because his Honor erred in submitting the case to the jury under the law of attractive nuisance as defined by the Supreme Court of this State, the error being that under the undisputed facts and circumstances there existed\nno cause of action against the defendant under the doctrine of attractive nuisance.\n\n(14) Because his Honor erred in refusing defendant's motion for a new trial upon the minutes of the Court, the error being that the case does not come under the doctrine of attractive nuisance, and that the verdict of the jury was against the clear preponderance of the testimony, and contrary to the law.\n\n(15) Because his Honor erred in refusing the defendant's motion, at the conclusion of all the testimony, for a directed verdict in his favor, and in charging the jury and in refusing defendant's motion for new trial on the minutes of the Court, the error being that the testimony fails to show (a) any actional negligence on the part of the defendant, (b) that there was a place of amusement for children of tender years at the place in question to the knowledge of the defendant, and (c) that the defendant maintained an attractive nuisance, and (d) that the location was in a thickly populated community, and (e) that the plaintiff's intestate was a bright, intelligent boy, but well knew of the danger of the washout, and was warned against going in the same, and (f) that no such action can lie against the Director General of Railroads, the cause of action not being predicated upon the Director General's common carrier liability, and (g) in that the presiding Judge in substance and effect held that the construction and maintenance of the embankment or fill containing the pipe through which the stream ran was an artificial erection, construction or instrumentality within the scope of the attractive nuisance doctrine, and that the defendant owed plaintiff's intestate the duty of protecting and safeguarding the same, which it had failed to do, and that therefore the defendant's failure in this respect was the direct and proximate cause of the death of plaintiff's intestate; and (h) that his Honor, as appears from his charge and his rulings, practically made the test\nof liability in the case depend upon the alleged negligence of the defendant in the construction and maintenance of the fill and pipe across the stream in question.", "procedural_history": "", "scdb_id": "", "sibling_ids": [3877466, 3877465, 3877464], "source": "ZU", "status": "Published", "suitNature": "", "syllabus": ""}
