At the point where the accident occurred there were two tracas running north and south upon which cars were run in opposite directions. On nearing the crossing, plaintiff could see that there was no car on the north-bound track. His view of the south-bound track was so obstructed by a wagon, and by piles of lumber and brick, that he could not see more than twenty-five feet of the track from his place of observation. For these obstructions, the street railway company was not responsible. Ahead of him, and moving in the same direction, was a wagon loaded with iron, and the noise created by it was sufficient to drown the noise made by an approaching car. Without stopping to listen, or to wait a moment for the abatement of the noise which prevented his hearing, he drove upon the tracks, and a south-bound car struck his buggy and injured him.
