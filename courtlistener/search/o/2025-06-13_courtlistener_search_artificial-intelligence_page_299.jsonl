While a fireman employed by a railroad company in this District \u00cd3 rightfully and necessarily on the company\u2019s premises on his way to assume his duties, to which he has been called by the company, the relation of master and servant exists between him and the company, within the contemplation of the employers\u2019 liability act of Congress of June 11, 1906 (34 Stat. at L. 232, chap. 3073, U.

(Citing Baltimore & P. R. Go. v. Golway, 6 App. D. C. 143, and Glaria v. Washington Southern R. Go. 30 App. D. C. 559.) .</p> <p>4. In an action against a carrier under the employers\u2019 liability act of. Congress of June 11, 1906 (34 Stat. at L. 232, chap. 3073, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, p. 1148), for the death of one of its employees resulting from its negligence, the trial' court properly permits the jury to compare the negligence of the decedent with the negligence of the defendant, and to render a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, if they find that the negligence of the decedent was slight, and that of the defendant\" gross, \u2014 the damages, however, to be\" diminished in proportion to the amount of the negligence attributable to the decedent.</p> <p>5. The doctrine of assumption of risks in the law of master and servant, which results from the contractual relation of the parties, cannot be successfully interposed as a defense by a carrier to an action under the employers\u2019 liability act of Congress of June 11, 1906 (34 Stat. at L. 232, chap. 3073, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, p. 1148), for the death of one of its employees, by reason of its alleged negligence, in view of the provision of sec. 3 \u201cthat no contract of employment * * * .shall constitute any bar or defense to an action brought to recover damages for personal injuries or death of such employee;\u201d and the subsequent employers\u2019 liability act of Congress of April 22, 1908 (35 Stat. at L. 65, chap. 149, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, p. 1171), is not to be interpreted as a legislative declaration that- the prior act does not do away with the. doctrine, in so far at least as the injury forming the basis of the action may have resulted from the negligence of the carrier.</p> <p>6. A verdict in an action for damages for wrongful death is not erroneous because there was no direct evidence as to the age or health of the decedent\u2019s widow, or the health of her infant child born shortly after the death of the decedent, nor evidence as to their probable duration of life, where the widow appeared before the jury as a witness and the evidence showed the age of the decedent.</p> <p>7. While annuity or life tables are admissible in evidence in an action to recover damages for wrongful death, they are not controlling.</p>"}

{"absolute_url": "/opinion/4235300/blumenthal-v-city-of-cheyenne/", "attorney": "For the Plaintiffs and Appellants, the cause was submitted upon the brief and also oral argument of Mr. J.A. Greenwood of Cheyenne, Wyoming.\n\nFor the Defendants and Respondents, the cause was submitted upon the brief and also oral argument of Mr. John U. Loomis and Mr. Arthur Kline, both of Cheyenne, Wyoming.\n\n                     POINTS OF COUNSEL FOR APPELLANTS \nThere is no general power to regulate the use of the streets, let alone the power to prohibit the use thereof. Western Auto Transports v. City of Cheyenne, 1942,  57 Wyo. 351 , 120 P.2d 590 .\n\nCheyenne is a legislative creature of delegated powers and has only those powers which have been granted to it by the State. Western Auto Transports v. City of Cheyenne, 1942,  57 Wyo. 351 , 377 ,  120 P.2d 590 ; May v. City of Laramie, 1942,  58 Wyo. 240 , 271 ,  131 P.2d 300 ; Whipps, et al. v. Town of Greybull, 56 Wyo. 355 ,  109 P.2d 355 ; Lakota Oil  Gas Co. v. City of Casper,  57 Wyo. 329 ,  341 ,  116 P.2d 861 .\n\nIn the exercise of power over streets, the delegated authority of the city of Cheyenne, if any, is very inferior and subordinate, and specific and express authority must be found before it can enact any legislation, since the control of the streets is primarily a state duty and the powers of the state of Wyoming are paramount. Western Auto Transports v. City of Cheyenne, Supra. 25 A.J. Highways, Sec. 255, Page 548.\n\nIt is elementary that control over the streets and highways within the corporate limits of a municipality is reserved in the state, and that the municipality can exercise only such control as his been delegated to it by the state. Martin, Mayor v. Rowlett, 1932,  185 Okla. 431 ,  93 P.2d 1090 .\n\nAny statute granting powers to a municipality must be strictly construed and any reasonable doubt as to the existence of the powers must be resolved against the municipality. Whipps, et al. vs. Town of Greybull, supra; City of Tulsa v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.,  75 F.2d 343 .\n\nIt is a well-settled general rule that municipalities, having the power to regulate the use of their streets,\nmay enact valid rules and regulations for the government of motor vehicles within their boundaries, so long as they are not in conflict with or repugnant to legislative enactments governing the use of such vehicles, but that such ordinances are invalid if they are in conflict with statutes relating to the subject. 5 A.J. 536-557.\n\nThe ordinance is invalid since the city is endeavoring to legislate on a matter of statewide concern. Clayton v. State, 1931,  38 Ariz. 135 ,  297 P. 1037 ; Ex Parte Daniels, 1920, 183 Cal. 636 ,  192 P. 442 ; City of Tulsa v. Southwestern Belle Telephone Co.,  75 F.2d 343 ,  353 .\n\nThe streets of a city belong to the people of the state, and every citizen of the state has a right to the use thereof, subject to legislative control. Ex Parte Daniels, supra.\n\nThe ordinance is invalid since the city has denied the use of its streets to public carriers who have been licensed by the State of Wyoming. Western Auto Transports v. Cheyenne, supra.\n\nThe city can compel railroads to construct at their own cost and subject to the direction of the city such additional viaducts or subways as the city might deem necessary. Missouri Pacific R. Co. v. Omaha,  235 U.S. 121 ,  59 L.Ed. 157 ; Erie Rd. Co. v. Bd. of Public Utility Comm.,  254 U.S. 394 ,  65 L.Ed. 322 ; Chicago Minn. \nSt. P.R.R. Co. v. Minneapolis,  232 U.S. 430 ,  58 L.Ed. 671 ,  674 .\n\nCourts are ever vigilant to prevent an abuse of discretion. Weber v. City of Cheyenne, 1940,  55 Wyo. 202 ,  97 P.2d 667 ; McQuillan, Municipal Corporations, 2nd Ed. Vol. 1, Sec. 391.\n\nCourts have been vigilant and ever ready to invalidate an arbitrary or unreasonable ordinance. Weaver\nv. Public Service Commission, 1929,  40 Wyo. 462 ,  278 P. 542 ; Western Auto Transport v. Cheyenne, supra; Arlington v. Lillard, 1927,  116 Tex. 446 ,  294 S.W. 829  cited in 121 A.L.R. 573 and 586; Walker v. Comm., 1909, 40 P. Sup. Ct. 638, 121 A.L.R. 576.\n\n                     POINTS OF COUNSEL FOR RESPONDENTS \nA municipal corporation may, under its police power, regulate in a reasonable manner vehicular traffic on its streets. City v. Breazeale, (La.)  187 So. 33 ,  34 .\n\nThe regulation of motor vehicles on particular streets, even to their complete exclusion therefrom, when deemed necessary in the public interest, is within the police power delegated to municipalities. Garneau v. Eggers, (N.J.)  174 A. 250 .\n\nThe police power is not limited to regulation designed to promote public health, public morals or public safety, or to the suppression of what is offensive, disorderly or unsanitary, but extends to so dealing with conditions that exist to bring out of them the greatest welfare of the people by promoting public convenience or general prosperity. People v. Patrick, 14 N.Y.S. 2d 249.\n\nRegulation of street congestion or obstruction is not only proper, but becomes increasingly necessary. City v. Marriotto, (Ill.)  163 N.E. 369 ,  370 ; Staley v. Vaughn, (Colo.) 17 P.2d 299 ,  301 ; Simpson v. City, (Cal.)  47 P.2d 474 ,  476 .\n\nThe regulation of motor vehicles on particular streets, even to their complete exclusion therefrom when deemed necessary in the public interest, is within the police power delegated to municipalities. Garneau v. Eggers, (N.J.)  174 A. 250 .\n\nIt is the province of the council to decide in what streets or parts of streets, during what hours, and for what length of time, limitation of the right to park or\nallow a vehicle to remain standing on the street is necessary to a proper regulation of traffic. City v. McKinley, (Ill.) 176 N.E. 261 ,  265 .\n\nThe court is not at liberty to substitute its judgment for that of the municipality as to the best methods of relieving traffic congestion in any specified area, in the interest of the welfare of the inhabitants and frequenters of the city. People, etc. Co. v. City, (N.J.)  144 A. 630 ,  633 .\n\nCities have wide discretion in the regulation of streets under the police power. New Orleans, etc., Inc. v. City,  281 U.S. 682 , 686 .\n\nAn ordinance which regulates the manner in which streets shall be used is valid, unless it is unreasonable and oppressive or is in conflict with state legislation upon the subject. City v. Ashland, etc. Co. (Ky.)  7 So.2d 833 ,  835 ; Weaver v. Public Service Comm.,  40 Wyo. 462 .\n\nThe power to regulate the use of streets by vehicles includes the power to promote the general welfare and prevent accidents, and the reasonableness of police regulation is not necessarily what is best, but what is fairly appropriate under all circumstances. People v. Thompson, (Ill.)  173 N.E. 137 .\n\nIn legislating for the public welfare, legislative bodies may, usually do, and should base their action upon actual conditions as they exist. It is to such conditions that the legislation will apply and it is such that will be affected thereby. Peoples, etc., Co. v. Henshaw, (C.C.A. 8)  20 F.2d 87 .\n\nIt has been judicially declared that no ordinance which tends to facilitate the movement of traffic can be said to be an unreasonable exercise of the police power. City v. Roe (Wash.) 68 P.2d 1028 ,  1029 .\n\nUnder the general welfare clause it is doubtless within the power of the city to make reasonable regulation as to the use of the streets and thus provide for the safety and convenience of travel and against unnecessary injury to the streets used. It is competent for the city to regulate the weight of loads that shall pass over the paved streets, and to prescribe the width of tires of vehicles carrying heavy loads. It has even been determined that municipalities may confine the passage of heavily loaded traffic to certain streets and exclude it from others, but the regulation must not be such as will deprive a citizen of access to his home or business house, nor from the use of the streets for any of the recognized means of travel. Brown v. Nichols, (Kan.)  145 P. 561 .\n\nThe regulation of motor vehicles on particular streets, even to their complete exclusion therefrom when deemed necessary in the public interest, is within the police jurisdicton delegated to municipalities. Garneau v. Eggers,  113 N.J. Law 245 , 174 A. 250 .\n\nCompensable damages do not result to adjacent property owners from public uses of streets. Foster's, Inc. v. City, (Ida.) 118 P.2d 721 .\n\nStreets may be devoted to any proper use incident to the construction and maintenance of the public thoroughfare. Such use is not a new or additional taking for public use, and the adjacent owner must suffer the injury or inconvenience resulting from such use. City v.
