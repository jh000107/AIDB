Atlee,  for plaintiff in error. &#8212; A county, being one of the political subdivisions of the State, is intrusted with powers to be exercised for the general welfare of the public as a part of the sovereign power of the State, and is not responsible for the misfeasance or omission of duty of the county officers elected by the people, with reference to duties the performance of which is prescribed by general statute law; and the appellee is not responsible for the acts complained of in the pretended action of defendant.\n\nIt being made by general statute law the duty of county officers, elected by the people, to apportion the available county school fund in a manner directed by general statute law, for the faithful performance of which duty a bond is required of such officers, an action by a school district or the trustees thereof to recover a distributive share of such fund to which it would be entitled in a proper apportionment thereof, does not lie against the county, when such action is founded on the failure of said officers to properly apportion said fund, whereby the entire fund was apportioned and used in maintaining the public schools of the county outside of such school district and that district received no part of its share of the fund.\n\nAs to a duty enjoined by statute, the misfeasance of a county officer elected by the people, resulting in a loss to a school district of the county of its pro rata of the available county school fund, and in the use of said fund entirely in maintaining the public schools of the county outside of such district, can not be the foundation of a legal claim against the county as for money had and received and appropriated or converted to the use and benefit of the county.\n\nAuthorities: Rev.

Mullaly,  for defendant in error. &#8212; The obligation to do justice rests upon all persons, natural and artificial, and if a county uses for its own purposes money or property collected for others, the law, independent of any statute, will compel restitution or compensation. Marsh v. Fulton County, 10 Wall, 676; Chapman v. Douglas County,  107 U.S. 348 ; United States v. Bank,  96 U.S. 30 ; Louisiana v. Wood,  102 U.S. 294 ; Aldrich v. Bank,  176 U.S. 618 .\n\nWhile a county may not be responsible for the misfeasances, or wrongs, or negligences, or omissions of duty of its subordinate officers in the administration of offices created by statute and in the performance of duties enjoined by statute, whereby others are damaged and no corresponding benefit is enjoyed by the county, yet such rule does not apply to a case where the county through its officers appropriates to its own use money collected for the benefit of another. Same authorities.\n\nThe use by Webb County of money collected for the benefit of the independent school district of Laredo, for any purpose of its own, whereby it enjoyed the benefit of such money, was as much a conversion of the money as any conversion known to the law. Same authorities.\n\nThe right of action of interveners is against Webb County and not against its subordinate officers and their sureties, because the county, and not such officers, get the benefit of the use of the money claimed. Same authorities.\n\nThe county superintendent's bond being payable to the county commissioners court and their successors in office, and any recovery thereon becoming a part of the available school fund of the county, it is not within the power of interveners to maintain action thereon, and therefore such an action would afford them no relief. Rev. Stats., art. 3929b.\n\nArticle 7 of section 6 of the Constitution imposes upon counties (not their officers) the duty of administering their school funds arising out of lands granted them for educational purposes, as trustees; and makes the counties (not their officers) responsible for all investments of the proceeds of sales of such lands, and provides that the interest and other revenues of such lands shall be available fund. The county is the owner of the fund, in trust; as the principal of this fund can not be expended or impaired by the county, it is apparent that the trust is valueless except as it produces revenue, for the revenue is the only thing about it that can be enjoyed. If the county is the express trustee of the fund and responsible for its integrity, and\ncharged with the duty of making that fund productive, it inevitably follows that the county is equally the express trustee of the product of the fund and charged with the duty of applying it in the manner provided by law. If the proper application of the product of the fund was not intended, by section 6 of article 7 of the Constitution, to be safeguarded thereby as much as the principal of the fund itself, then said provision of the Constitution serves no useful purpose. With the utmost care it guards the safety and integrity of the principal of the fund upon the entire financial responsibility of the county (not the officers of the county and their sureties), and the plain intention is there manifested to thus provide a revenue which shall be available for school purposes. No such solicitude could have been felt by the framers of the Constitution for the preservation of the principal of the fund except to insure a revenue available for the specific purpose therein stated. The revenue being the object sought, it seems a reflection on the intelligence of such framers to say that they did not intend to safeguard with equal care its expenditure for the very purpose for which it was so created.\n\nIf this is the effect of the constitutional provision, then it is unimportant what county officers failed in their duty to apportion and pay over to defendant in error the part of the revenue due to the independent school district of Laredo, the county itself being the express trustee. If the subordinate county officers failed in their duty, the Commissioners Court, as the general supervising and auditing board of the county, could have required them to comply, and that court in failing to exact such compliance was equally at fault. Being a corporation, the county could as easily have performed its duty as express trustee for the distribution of the fund through the agency of its officers, just as every other act done in its name is performed. The defense relied upon by plaintiff in error is, that the trustee's officers having spent the trust funds for the benefit of the trustee, there is no money left and the trustee is therefore not liable to the beneficiary.", "caseName": "Webb County v.
