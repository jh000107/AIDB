There is no conscience in the case; it is not a question of conscience at all; it is simply a question o\u00ed judgment. Men differ in their opinions as to the testimony, or as to questions of fact, or as to the propriety of a verdict. It is simply a difference in judgment and no question o\u00ed conscience whatever in the case.\u201d</p> <p>A juror in reaching a conclusion as to a verdict must be guided by conscience in the different steps leading up to a conclusion, and he cannot at the mere behest o\u00ed his fellow jurors, or on the order of their trial judge, adopt another conclusion from that which he has conscientiously reached, for his oath enjoins that he, the juror, shall \u201ca true verdict rendo- on the evidence.\u201d</p> <p>After a jury has reported to the court that they stand ten to two, and that they are not able to agree, it is error for the court to say to them that if they do not agree it is not improbable that the public will suspect some of them of corruption, and to intimate that a disagreement might be due to self-will or stubbornness, a proper penalty for which offense would in; the disgrace of exclusion from the jury wheel and the posting of their unlitness in a public office, and finally that he could not think of discharging them even if they had to remain for weeks in the jury room.</p> <p>After a judge had told a jury which had reported a disagreement that they were bound to agree, and that he would keep them in the jury room for weeks, he further told them that after a verdict was received and entered he would hear anything that a juror would say, and would take any such statement into consideration, on a motion of anew trial. The jury sealed a verdict, and included with the verdict a paper stating their former disagreement, and reminding the judge of the suggestion which ho had made that he would consider the disagreement on a motion for a new trial. Held, that the verdict was not invalidated by the paper which accompanied it, but that the promise on the part of the judge to consider on a motion for a new trial whatever a juror might have t\u00f3 say was error.</p> <p>Evidence \u2014 Credibility of witness \u2014 Remoteness of time.</p> <p>Evidence as to the credibility of a witness, which relates to a period four years prior to the trial, is too remote.</p> <p>Decedents' estates \u2014 Issue devisavit vel non \u2014 Evidence.</p> <p>On the trial of an issue devisavit vel non a letter of testator\u2019s wife, whom he survived, to one of defendants, reflecting on the character of the party addressed, and possibily inferentially prejudicing the plaintiffs, is not admissible on the part of defendants, as it is a mere declaration by a third person, long deceased.</p> <p>On the trial of an issue devisavit vel non, where a daughter who has been discriminated against alleges undue influence by her brother, evidence of unpleasant relations between the deceased and the daughter\u2019s husband is admissible, as having some bearing on the existence of a possible motive other than that caused by undue influence for discriminating against the daughter.</p> <p>Decedents' estates \u2014 Issue devisavit vel non \u2014 Estoppel\u2014Evidence.</p> <p>The fact that a contestant of a will at one time claimed under the will does not constitute a legal estoppel of his right to contest the will, although it is a fact which may detract from the strength of his later contention, and the significance or weight of it is for the jury, in view of all the other evidence in the case.</p> <p>Decedents' estates \u2014 Issue devisavit vel non \u2014 Evidence.</p> <p>On the trial of an issue devisavit vel non it is improper to permit witness to express an opinion as to what caused ill feeling between testator and his wife. The witness must be confined merely to a statement of any facts tending to show the cause of the trouble.</p> <p>In a will contest, a daughter who was discriminated against alleged un-. due influence on the part of her brother. The brother, however, contended that the cause of the discrimination was the drunkenness of his sister\u2019s husband. A letter written in answer to testator\u2019s telegram by a brother of the sister\u2019s husband expressing regret for the drunkenness of the husband was admitted in evidence. It appeared that the writer of the telegram had no personal knowledge of his brother\u2019s habits, but simply repeated what others had told him. He was not a party to the suit, and was in no way interested in it. Held, that the admission of the letter in evidence was error.</p> <p>In a contest over a will in which a son is largely preferred, if it appears that the son, although not the father\u2019s attorney, was his trusted and confidential agent, the burden of proof is on the son to rebut the presumption of undue influence.</p>"}
