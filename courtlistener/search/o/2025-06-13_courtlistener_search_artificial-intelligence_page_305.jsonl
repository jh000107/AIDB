{"absolute_url": "/opinion/3551931/smith-v-harbison-walker-refractories-co/", "attorney": "F.H. Atwood  and  Hollingsworth  Francis  for appellant.\n\n(1) The second amended petition constituted a departure and a variance from the original and first amended petitions. Defendant's motions to strike were erroneously overruled. Jacobs v. Railroad Co., 204 S.W. 954; Scovill v. Glasner,  79 Mo. 449 ; Arrowood v. Delaney's Estate. 295 S.W. 522; Liese v. Meyer, 143 Mo. 547 ; Ross v. Land Co.,  162 Mo. 317 : Purdy v. Pfaff. 104 Mo. App. 331 . (2) The court erred in submitting this case to the jury for the reasons: (a) There was\nno proof either that the defendant was engaged in any work or process that produced occupational disease nor that the disease which plaintiff claimed to have contracted was an occupational disease. Wolf v. Mallinckrodt Chemical Works,  81 S.W.2d 323 ; Lovell v. Williams Bros., 50 S.W.2d 713; Industrial Commission v. Roth, 120 N.E. 172, 6 A.L.R. 1463; Maupin v. Am. Cigar Co., 84 S.W.2d 218 . (b) There was no proof that defendant knew, or could have known, that the dust generated at its plant was disease producing. Kolbow v. Haynes-Langenburg Mfg. Co., 3 S.W.2d 226 ; St. Joseph Lead Co. v. Jones,  70 F.2d 475 ; Wolf v. Mallinckrodt Chemical Works,  81 S.W.2d 333 ; Maupin v. American Cigar Co.,  84 S.W.2d 218 . (c) There was no proof that there was any device or means known to be more effective than the devices and means used by defendant to prevent inhalation of dust. Pevesdorf v. Union E.L.  P. Co., 64 S.W.2d 947; B.  O. Ry. Co. v. Groeger, 45 Sup. Ct. 149; Penn. Pulverizing Co. v. Butler,  61 F.2d 311 . (3) Plaintiff's Instruction 2 was erroneous in that: (a) It assumed there was evidence that plaintiff was engaged in an occupation which might produce disease peculiar to the work or process being done. Cases under subsections (a) and (b), Point (2). (b) It gave the jury a roving commission to determine what constituted \"approved and effective devices\" within the meaning of Section 13252. Wolf v. Mallinckrodt Chemical Works,  81 S.W.2d 333 ; Pevesdorf v. Union E.L.  P. Co., 64 S.W.2d 948; Plank v. Brown Petroleum Co., 61 S.W.2d 332; Parks v. Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass Co., 195 N.E. 616 ; Boshuizen v. Thompson-Taylor Co.,  195 N.E. 625 . (4) Plaintiff's Instruction 6-A was erroneous in that: (a) The law only required defendant to adopt such devices as were the ordinary general and customary devices in use at that time; whereas, said instruction fixed defendant's liability as an insurer. Pevesdorf v. Union E.L.  P. Co., 64 S.W.2d 948. (b) Said instruction omitted the requirement that the defendant must, or could have, known that the dust generated at its plant was dangerous and that defendant must have known, or could have known, that the grinder and hood were inadequate, and that defendant knew, or could have known, that there were other devices more effective. Wolf v. Mallinckrodt Chemical Works, 81 S.W.2d 323 . (c) There was no evidence of any means of ventilation more adequate than the means used by defendant. Wolf v. Mallinckrodt Chemical Works,  81 S.W.2d 323 . (d) There was no evidence that any respirator was made or marketed that was effective. Pevesdorf v. Union E.L.  P. Co., 64 S.W.2d 948; Wolf v. Mallinckrodt Chemical Works,  81 S.W.2d 323 . (e) It gave the jury a roving commission to determine the means and methods of ventilation required of defendant. Pevesdorf v. Union E.L.  P. Co., 64 S.W.2d 947; Degonia v. Ry. Co.,  224 Mo. 564 ; State ex rel. Cent. Coal  Coke Co. v. Ellison,  270 Mo. 645 ; Gandy v. Ry. Co., 44\n393 S.W.2d 634. (f) It was calculated to lead the jury into awarding a verdict in favor of plaintiff if defendant failed to furnish respirators or failed to post notices of known dangers or failed to ventilate the room, regardless of whether such failures were the proximate cause of plaintiff's injuries. Pevesdorf v. Union E.L.  P. Co., 64 S.W.2d 946. (5) Plaintiff's Instruction 6 was erroneous in that: (a) There was no evidence authorizing a jury to find that the defendant knew, or could have known, that there was danger to plaintiff's health in doing the work required of him or that defendant knew, or could have known, of any means or device to prevent his injuries. Cases under subsections (b) and (c), Point (2). (b) It permitted the jury to determine that failure to post notices of known dangers was the proximate cause of plaintiff's injuries without any evidence to support such a finding. Friegge v. Brooks, 70 S.W.2d 995; State v. Melton,  33 S.W.2d 894 ; Larsen v. Webb, 58 S.W.2d 967 . (6) Plaintiff's Instruction 4 was erroneous in that it authorized a verdict for plaintiff if defendant failed to provide plaintiff with an adequate respirator, there being no evidence that there was an adequate respirator on the market or that defendant could have known of such a respirator. Wolf v. Mallinckrodt Chemical Works,  81 S.W.2d 323 ; Pevesdorf v. Union El. P.  L. Co., 64 S.W.2d 947. (7) Plaintiff's Instruction 3 was erroneous in authorizing the jury to return a verdict in favor of plaintiff if defendant failed to ventilate the enclosure whereat plaintiff worked so as to render harmless all dust as near as could be, for the reasons: (a) It assumed that defendant knew, or could have known, that the dust generated at the grinders was hurtful and harmful. (b) It assumed that defendant knew, or could have known, of means of ventilating the room. (c) It gave the jury a roving commission to determine how and in what manner said room could be so ventilated. (8) Plaintiff's Instruction 1 was erroneous in that it made defendant an insurer of plaintiff's safety contrary to the authorities heretofore cited.\n\n A.C. Whitson  and  S.D. Flanagan  for respondent.\n\n(1) Plaintiff's second amended petition was not a departure from his prior petitions. His cause of action was not changed, and there was no new cause of action grafted on the stem of the original proceeding. The same evidence would support all the petitions, the same measure of damages would apply to all, and a recovery under the original petition would bar a recovery under the second amended petition. There was, therefore, no departure. Wright v. Groom,  246 Mo. 163 , 151 S.W. 465; Jacobs v. Railroad Co., 204 S.W. 956; Walker v. Railroad Co.,  193 Mo. 477 , 92 S.W. 83 ; Rippee v. Ry. Co.,  154 Mo. 364 , 55 S.W. 438; Schwab Clothing Co. v. Railroad Co.,  71 Mo. App. 241 ; Stewart  Jackson v. Van Horne,  91 Mo. App. 656 ;\nHudson v. Railroad Co.,  173 Mo. App. 631 , 159 S.W. 9; Bick v. Vaughn,  140 Mo. App. 595 , 120 S.W. 618; Jensen v. Hinberks, 92 S.W.2d 109; Hughes v. Abraham Lincoln Life Ins. Co., 84 S.W.2d 973. Even if there was a departure defendant waived any objection thereto by pleading to the second amended petition and by going to trial thereon. Cain v. Cap Sheaf Bread Co., 57 S.W.2d 763; Ingwerson v. Ry. Co.,  205 Mo. 336 , 103 S.W. 1143; Grymes v. Mill  Lbr. Co.,  11 Mo. App. 362 , 85 S.W. 946; Sanguinett v. Webster,  153 Mo. 367 , 54 S.W. 563; Liese v. Meyer, 143 Mo. 556 , 45 S.W. 282. If defendant could not be ready for trial by reason of the amendment, it should have asked for a continuance by filing an affidavit of surprise, and having failed to do so, it waived any objection that the allowance of the amendment worked a surprise on it. Sec. 941, R.S. 1929; Kuh v. Garvin, 28 S.W. 847,  125 Mo. 547 ; Grymes v. Lumber Co., 85 S.W. 946,  111 Mo. App. 358 . (2) The court did not err in submitting this case to the jury as: (a) There was ample proof that the defendant was engaged in a work or process that produced illness and disease peculiar and incident thereto. Plank v. Brown Petroleum Co.,  332 Mo. 1150 ,  61 S.W.2d 328 . (b) There was ample evidence to establish that defendant knew or should have known that the dusts generated at its grinders were harmful. Defendant will be presumed to have knowledge of the dangers inherent in the dust generated under the rule that the master is bound to take into account the properties of such substances as he employs for the purposes of his business, even though it is scientific information if it be readily attainable. Wolf v. Mallinckrodt Chemical Works,  81 S.W.2d 333 ,  336 Mo. 746 ; Mooney v. Monark Gasoline  Oil Co.,  317 Mo. 1255 ,  298 S.W. 69 ; Hysell v. Swift  Co.,  78 Mo. App. 44 ; Thompson v. United Laboratories Co.,  221 Mass. 280 , 108 N.E. 1044; Fritz v. Elk Tannery Co.,  258 Pa. 180 , 101 A. 158; Harvey v. Welch, 163 A. 417 ; Adams v. Refrigerator Co.,  160 Mich. 593 , 125 N.W. 725, 27 L.R.A. (N.S.) 953. (c) There was ample proof from defendant's own witnesses that there were efficient and effective respirators in general use, which defendant could have provided for plaintiff. However, it was not necessary for plaintiff to show that there was any device or means known to be more effective than the device used by defendant, as plaintiff made out a case by showing that defendant was carrying on a work or process which was likely to produce illness or disease peculiar or incident thereto, and that it failed to provide adequate devices, means and methods to prevent such illness and diseases. Boll v. Condie-Bray Glass \nPaint Co.,  321 Mo. 92 ,  11 S.W.2d 48 . Defendant's duty to furnish a respirator was mandatory under the statute and it could not excuse its failure to provide a respirator by showing that it had provided another device, which in its opinion was as good or better. Millsap v. Beggs,  122 Mo. App. 10 , 97 S.W. 956; May v. Belleville Enameling Stamping\nCo.,  247 Ill. App. 281 . (3) Plaintiff's Instruction 2 was not erroneous. (a) There was ample evidence that plaintiff was engaged in an occupation which might produce disease peculiar and incident to the work being carried on. Cases under subsection (a), Point (2). (b) It was not erroneous as giving the jury a roving commission to determine what constituted approved and effective devices within the meaning of Section 13252. It was not necessary under this statute for the plaintiff to show that there were any approved and effective devices which defendant might have used. Therefore, the jury did not have to find such fact. Boll v. Condie-Bray Glass  Paint Co.,  321 Mo. 92 , 11 S.W.2d 48 . (4) Plaintiff's Instruction 6a was not erroneous. (a) The test of ordinary and customary usage of other employers in the same industry is not controlling in a case submitted under the statutes. The statutes prescribe certain definite duties which are mandatory and must be complied with by the employer. He cannot avoid this liability by showing that he has adopted other means which in his opinion, and in the opinion of others in the same industry, are just as good. Millsap v. Beggs, 122 Mo. App. 10 , 97 S.W. 956; May v. Belleville Enameling  Stamping Co., 247 Ill. App. 281 ; Boll v. Condie-Bray Glass  Paint Co.,  321 Mo. 92 , 11 S.W.2d 48 . (b) It was not necessary that the jury find that the defendant knew or could have known that the dust generated at its plant was dangerous. Defendant is presumed to have knowledge of the danger inherent in said dust. Cases under subsection (b), Point (2). It was not necessary that the jury find that defendant knew or could have known that the grinder and hood were inadequate. If they were inadequate, then a case was made under the statute, and it was immaterial whether defendant had knowledge of such inadequacy or not. Boll v. Condie-Bray Glass \nPaint Co.,  321 Mo. 92 ,  11 S.W.2d 48 . Likewise, it was not necessary that the jury find that there were other devices more effective than those used by defendant. All they had to find was that the devices used by the defendant were inadequate. Boll v. Condie-Bray Glass  Paint Co.,  321 Mo. 92 ,  11 S.W.2d 48 . (c) There was evidence of means of ventilation more adequate than the means used by defendant. However, such proof was not necessary as a case was made out by showing that the devices used by defendants were inadequate. Boll v. Condie-Bray Glass  Paint Co.,  321 Mo. 92 ,  11 S.W.2d 48 . (d) There was ample evidence that respirators were in general use in other brick manufacturing plants, and that they were efficient and effective. However, this proof was not necessary in view of the mandatory requirement of the statute that respirators be furnished. Boll v. Condie-Bray Glass  Paint Co.,  321 Mo. 92 ,  11 S.W.2d 48 . (e) This instruction did not direct a verdict and, therefore, did not give the jury a roving commission to do anything. It was not necessary, however, for the jury to find what means or methods defendant could have provided to comply with the\nstatute, and therefore, they were given no roving commission to do so. Boll v. Condie-Bray Glass  Paint Co.,  321 Mo. 92 , 11 S.W.2d 48 . (f) This instruction was not erroneous as permitting the jury to determine that failure to post notice of known dangers was the proximate cause of plaintiff's injuries. The purpose of such notice was to constantly warn plaintiff of the danger inherent in the dust generated at the grinders, and the jury could properly have found that defendant's failure to post such notice was the proximate cause of his injuries. Millsap v. Beggs, 122 Mo. App. 10 , 97 S.W. 956; Roehrig v. American Car  Foundry Co., 257 S.W. 1086; Plank v. Brown Petroleum Co.,  332 Mo. 1150 , 61 S.W.2d 328 . (5) Plaintiff's Instruction 4 was not erroneous in authorizing a verdict for plaintiff if defendant failed to provide plaintiff with an adequate respirator. There was ample evidence that there were adequate and efficient respirators in general use at other brick manufacturing plants, of which fact defendant should have had knowledge. However, it was not necessary that plaintiff introduce evidence showing that there were adequate respirators in use, and that defendant could have known thereof. Boll v. Condie-Bray Glass  Paint Co.,  321 Mo. 92 , 11 S.W.2d 48 . (6). Plaintiff's Instruction 3 was not erroneous. (a) Defendant was bound to know the harmful nature of the dusts generated at its grinders. (b) It was not necessary that the jury find that the defendant knew or could have known of means of ventilating the enclosures where plaintiff worked as he made out a case by showing that the devices used by defendant were inadequate. Boll v. Condie-Bray Glass  Paint Co., 321 Mo. 92 ,  11 S.W.2d 48 . (c) Since plaintiff did not have to prove that there were adequate means and devices which could have been used by defendant to ventilate the enclosures where plaintiff worked, it was not necessary for the jury to find said fact, and the jury was, therefore, not given any roving commission to do so. Boll v. Condie-Bray Glass  Paint Co.,  321 Mo. 92 , 11 S.W.2d 48 . (7) Plaintiff's Instruction 1 was not erroneous, since: (a) It was not necessary that the jury find that defendant knew or could have known that the dust was dangerous. (b) It was not necessary that the jury find that there were adequate devices to prevent the inhalation of said dust. Boll v. Condie-Bray Glass \nPaint Co.,  321 Mo. 92 ,  11 S.W.2d 48 . (8) The court did not err in refusing to give defendant's Instructions 11, 12 and 14 for the reason that they were contrary to the statutes, ignored the statutes, and attempted to set up the rule of customary usage by other employers in the same or similar industries in place of the statutes. Cases under subsection (a), Point (4). (9) The court did not err in striking out of defendant's answer that part thereof which pleaded as a defense the fact that the dust removing equipment used in connection with the Bridgeport grinder had been approved by the Commissioner of Labor and industrial Inspection of the State of Missouri, and in refusing to admit\ninto evidence the certificates of said Commissioner showing the approval of said equipment, and in refusing to give defendant's Instruction 5, based thereon. The duty laid upon the defendant by the statutes was mandatory, and the defendant could not excuse its noncompliance with the statutes by showing that what it did or failed to do had been approved by the Commissioner of Labor and Industrial Inspection. Simpson v. Iron Works Co., 249 Mo. 401 , 155 S.W. 779; Egan v. Railroad Co.,  42 N.Y.S. 188 , 12 App. Div. 556; Booth v. Stokes, 88 A. 490,  241 Pa. 349 ; Johnson v. Stein Gauge Co., 72 Hun, 535, 25 N.Y.S. 689; O'Connor v. Armour Packing Co., 158 F. 241; Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Donaldson,  246 U.S. 121 , 38 Sup. Ct. 230. (10) The court did not err in excluding the testimony offered by defendant that respirators were not considered by the fire brick industry as being as effective or adequate for removing dust as was the dust removing apparatus used in connection with the Bridgeport grinder. Since the evidence showed that there were noxious dusts produced by the grinder in harmful quantities, the use of respirators was mandatory under the statute, and it was wholly immaterial that the fire brick industry may have considered the equipment used by defendant as being more effective than respirators.
