{"absolute_url": "/opinion/4235524/afton-electric-co-v-harrison/", "attorney": "For the plaintiff in error the cause was submitted without oral argument upon the brief of  W.A. Muir  of Rock Springs.\n\nAs appears from the pleadings and the evidence, the action was tried and submitted upon the theory of \"attractive nuisance.\" There is a clear distinction recognized by the authorities between an object which is attractive in itself, and invites a trespass, and an object which does not invite a trespass. We submit that there is nothing in the record establishing the fact that the pole in question was an attractive nuisance. On the contrary, the evidence establishes the fact that decedent was not attracted by the pole in question, either before or after the trespass. Nor is there anything in the record showing that the officers of defendant company knew or should have known, or had information from which they should have anticipated that decedent would come in contact with the electric wires. 36 A.L.R. 294. Under the evidence, the doctrine of attractive nuisance cannot be invoked. Graves v. Washington Water Power Company, (Wash.) 87 P. 956 ; 11 L.R.A., (N.S.) 452, 456; Delaware L.  W.R. Co. v. Reich, 41 L.R.A. 831; Grube v. Baltimore, 1918E, L.R.A. 1036; Mayfield Water Company v. Webb, (Ky.)  111 S.W. 712 ; 45 C.J. 760-762. In order that liability may be imposed under the attractive nuisance doctrine, it is necessary that the condition or applicance which caused the injury should have actually attracted the child into danger, and hence the doctrine is not applicable where the injured child went into the dangerous situation for some other reason. 45 C.J. 767; United Zinc Company v. Britt,  258 U.S. 268 . The original case of Railroad Company v. Stout,  21 L.Ed. 745 , known as the \"Turntable Case,\" is referred to and\ndistinguished, also the well known case of U.P. Ry. Company v. McDonald,  38 L.Ed. 434 . The following cases illustrate the rules found in Corpus Juris: Hayko v. Coal Company, (Colo.) 235 P. 373 ; Carr v. Company, (Ore.)  261 P. 899 ; Water Company v. Harold, (Ind.)  83 N.E. 993 . The rule contended for by plaintiff in error seems to have been followed unanimously by the courts of this country. Giannini v. Campodonico, (Cal.)  169 P. 80 ; 9 R.C.L. 1209, 1213; Ramirez v. Cheyenne, 34 Wyoming 67; Howard v. Transmission Company, (Mo.) 49 A.L.R. 1034. The facts in the case at bar are much weaker than the facts disclosed in the foregoing authorities. The mere fact of an accident and resultant injury, does not, as a general rule, make out a prima facie case of negligence. State ex. rel. v. Trimble, 49 A.L.R. 1047. It is practically as easy for a boy to climb twenty or thirty feet above the ground as it is for him to climb fifteen feet. New York N.H.  H.R. Company v. Fruchter,  260 U.S. 141 . The case of Simonton v. Electric Light  Power Company,  67 S.W. 530 \nillustrates the doctrine of an attractive nuisance quite fully, also the cases of Robertson v. Rockland Light  Power Company, 176 N.Y. Supp. 281; McFarland v. Martin,  90 Pa. Sup. Ct. 151 . Supplementing annotations in 36 A.L.R. 135, 39 A.L.R. 488, 45 A.L.R. 987 and 53 A.L.R. 1350; Duron v. Iron Works, (Texas) 9 S.W.2d 1104, annotated 53 A.L.R. 1351; Whetherby v. Electric Company, (Vt.) 25 L.R.A. (N.S.) 1220; Reddy v. City, (S.D.) 220 N.W. 851 ; Salt River Valley Water Users' Association v. Compton, (Ariz.)  8 P.2d 249 . This latter case is of particular interest, since it involved facts somewhat similar to the case at bar. The attraction in the Salt River case was a bird's nest, which the boy climbed the pole to remove. In the present case, as disclosed by the evidence, Mack Harrison climbed the pole of Afton Electric Company in playing the game of\n\"Tarzan of the Apes,\" and for the purpose of discovering imaginary lions and natives. We submit that there is no evidence in this record indicating that the pole climbed by Mack Harrison, or anything in connection with its surroundings, was an \"attractive nuisance,\" within the rules recognized and followed by the authorities, and it is respectfully submitted that the judgment of the lower court should be reversed.\n\nThe cause was submitted without oral argument on the brief of Ivan S. Jones  of Kemmerer and  Thatcher  Young  of Ogden, Utah.\n\nThe principle of law involved in this case is stated in 20 R.C.L. 80, making one liable for the maintenance of an attractive nuisance where children are injured thereby. The doctrine is supported by the weight of authority. Mattson v. R. Company, 70 L.R.A. 503. Cahill v. Stone,  96 P. 84 ; Dahl v. D. Co., 52 L.R.A. (N.S.) 1173; Cooper v. Power Company, (Ore.)  244 P. 665 ; Ferrari v. New York C.R. Co., 60 A.L.R. 1452. Many of the cases involve injuries or death from electric current conducted by wires. Temple v. McComb, 11 L.R.A. (N.S.) 449; Burns v. Chicago, 248 Ill. 204 ; Heller v. New York, 17 A.L.R. 823; Stedwell v. Chicago, 17 A.L.R. 829; Beckwith v. Malden, (Mo.)  253 S.W. 17 . The rule that ordinary persons must all know danger attends contact with electric wires was held not to apply to a boy fourteen years old. Morris v. Jefferson Electric Company, 123 A. 321; Znidersich v. Utilities Co., (Minn.)  193 N.W. 449 . The element of attractiveness is present in any situation that encourages the inward urge of boys to climb. Robertson v. Company, 176 N.Y.S. 261; McKiddy v. Electric Company, (Iowa) 206 N.W. 815 ; Klingensmith v. Traction Company,  18 Ohio App. 290 ; Talkington v. Power Company, (Wash.)  165 P. 87 ; Mayer v. Menominee L.  T. Company, (Wisc.) 138 N.W. 1008;\nHays v. Southern Power Company, (S.C.)  78 S.E. 956 ; Ferrari v. R. Co. 230 N.Y.S. 60; Thompson v. Tilton L.  F. Company, (N.H.) 68 A. 216 . On the question of contributory negligence we cite Waterbury v. Water Company,  33 P.2d 1048 ; McKay v. Hedger, 34 P.2d 224. Findings of the trial court upon substantial evidence are as binding on the reviewing court as the verdict of a jury. Wolczek v. Public Service Company,  174 N.E. 577 ; Salt Lake Company v. Connell, (Wyo.)  34 P.2d 23 ; Phillips Petroleum Company v. Mattheson, (Okla.)  44 P.2d 56 ; Carillo v. Helms Bakeries, (Cal.)  44 P.2d 604 ; Ketchum v. Davis, (Wyo.)  13 P. 15 ; Farnum v. Power Company, (Mont.) 43 P.2d 640 ; McCormick v. Great Western Power Company, (Cal.) 8 P.2d 145 . We also cite on the doctrine of an attractive nuisance the following: Fort Wayne Company v. Stark, 126 N.E. 460; Sullivan v. Power Company,  9 P.2d 1038 ; Scott v. Power  Light Company, (Wash.)  35 P.2d 749 ; Brown v. Southern Cal. Company, (Cal.) 7 P.2d 770 . Compliance with the rules of the United States Bureau of Standards constitutes a standard of care and is not usually regarded as a defense to a charge of negligence. Anstead v. Gas Company, (Cal.)  265 P. 487 ; Brooks v. Consolidated Gas Company, (N.J.)  57 A. 396 ; Smith v. Company,  74 Pa. 647 . The facts proven in this case were that children played in the vicinity of this pole with the permission of the owner of the premises; that this particular pole was built much like a swing; that at the base of each pole were cedar stumps full of knots; that wires were so placed around the pole and the stumps that a child could use the same for steps; that by this means a child could easily climb the stump and when standing thereon could reach the braces and walk right up the braces to the top of the pole; that the decedent and the Procter boy were playing\non the day in question in the vicinity of this pole. A jury might therefore properly infer that decedent was lured by the attractiveness of this pole. 45 C.J. 767; Miller v. Gooding Highway District,  41 P.2d 625 .", "caseName": "Afton Electric Co. v.

{"absolute_url": "/opinion/4092631/hesse-v-travelers-ins-co/", "attorney": "Elverton H. Wicks , with him  Bialas, Ryan, McIntyre   Mackrell , for appellant. &#8212; The only real question raised by the record is, whether such an an&#230;sthetic death was occasioned by \"external, violent and accidental means.\" If it was, then the lower court was wrong in refusing to take off compulsory nonsuit: Moyer v. Electric Co.,  294 Pa. 265 ; Caldwell v. Tr. Co.,  291 Pa. 35 ; Baumgartner v. R. R.,  292 Pa. 106 .\n\nDeath resulting from the necessary administration of an an&#230;sthetic by a trained an&#230;sthetist under the supervision of a physician is the unusual and unexpected result attending on the operation or performance of a usual or necessary act, and the death is therefore effected by accidental means: Ins. Co. v. Burroughs,  69 Pa. 43 ; Burkhard v. Ins. Co.,  102 Pa. 262 ; Hey v. Indemnity Co.,  181 Pa. 220 ; Pickett v. Ins. Co.,  144 Pa. 79 ; Lane v. Baking Co.,  261 Pa. 329 .\n\nIt is submitted that the taking of the an&#230;sthetic in the case at bar is analogous in principle to those cases where poison is inadvertently taken, since in our case the an&#230;sthetic was poison to the insured: Bloom v. Accident Co.,  85 Pa. Super. 398 .\n\nDeath occasioned by drowning, asphyxiation or by the taking of any poison when such casualty is not designed by the insured, that is to say, when the act is not suicidal, is due to injuries effected through external, violent and accidental means.\n\nEven though the insured, at the time the injury is received, is suffering from some disease, defect or bodily infirmity, the company is liable if the injury is sufficient to bring about death entirely independent of, and without any reference to, the disease.\n  Samuel W. Pringle , with him  Dalzell, Dalzell  McFall , for appellee. &#8212; The evidence does not sustain a finding that the insured's death resulted solely from the administration of the an&#230;sthetic as contended by appellant, but even if that were conceded, such death cannot be regarded as effected directly and independently of all other causes through external, violent and accidental means.\n\nSince the necessary major operation was performed by the surgeon, chosen by the insured skillfully and without slip or mishap, a proper an&#230;sthetic administered correctly and in proper proportions, and nothing unforeseen, unexpected or unintended occurred in the acts preceding the almost instantaneous death, such death was not effected solely by external, violent and accidental means, whether or not the an&#230;sthetic alone caused the death: U.S. Mut. Accident Assn. v. Barry,  131 U.S. 100 ; Lane v. Baking Co.,  261 Pa. 329 ; Semancik v. Casualty Co.,  56 Pa. Super. 392 .\n\nEven though insured's death resulted from an&#230;sthesia, it was not a death effected by accidental means, since the danger of death from an&#230;sthesia is inherent in every such operation, and was a danger counted upon and recognized prior to the performance of the operation.", "caseName": "Hesse v.
