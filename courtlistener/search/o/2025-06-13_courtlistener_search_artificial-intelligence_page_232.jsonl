Before the law there is no such distinction, and in courts of justice all must be co-ordinated, irrespective of the accidents of artificial and conventional social relations.</p> <p>Witnesses\u2014Manner of Testing Credibility.\u2014Each witness is a man or woman to be treated as an individual, a moral unit, tested for integrity and veracity on his merits or her title to credit by the inherent and extrinsic elements of belief, or the circumstantial criteria of credibility. These are the only considerations for the court in weighing evidence.</p> <p>Insane Delusions\u2014Business Capacity.\u2014Business capacity may coexist with monomania or insane delusions.</p> <p>Insane Delusions\u2014Vulgarity of Testatrix.\u2014Where the vulgarity in behavior and speech of a testatrix is relied upon to establish the presence of insane delusions, her whole conduct, at home and aboard, should be considered, and not merely her conduct within her own house, the alleged acts of immodesty in this case being confined to the home premises of the testatrix, while her behavior abroad was not subject to adverse criticism.</p> <p>Insane Delusions\u2014Eccentricities not Suddenly Acquired.\u2014Eccentric habits of speech, if not suddenly acquired, are not evidence of insanity.</p> <p>Expert Evidence\u2014Its Nature and Value.\u2014-Expert evidence is really an argument of the expert to the court, and is valuable only with regard to the proof of the facts and the validity of the reasons advanced for the conclusions.</p> <p>Insane Delusions\u2014Suspicions as to Husband\u2019s Constancy.\u2014Where there was at least one instance in the conduct of a husband which might arouse in the mind of the wife a suspicion as to his constancy, the fact that her suspicions may have been unjust and her inferences too general, is merely an error of logic, and not an evidence of insanity or of an insane delusion. She has a right to infer, however erroneously, or from inadequate premises, to a universal conclusion.</p> <p>Insanity\u2014Faulty Logic.\u2014False logic or faulty ratiocination is far from the manifestation of insanity, so long as the process is formally correct, not incoherent or inconsequential.</p> <p>Insane Delusions\u2014Fear of Poisoning.\u2014A fear of poisoning on the part of a testatrix, even though a delusion, must, in order to invalidate her testamentary act, be continuous, persistent, and operative upon her volitional capacity.</p> <p>Insane Delusions\u2014Fear of Poisoning.\u2014The mistaken belief of a testatrix, when suffering with chronic stomach trouble, that her food has been tampered with, does not, as a matter of law, amount to an insane delusion.</p> <p>Insanity\u2014Unreasonable Suspicions.\u2014Unfounded and unreasonable suspicions are not insanity.</p> <p>Insanity\u2014Insomnia.\u2014The mind of a testatrix is not necessarily diseased because she is at times troubled with insomnia while afflicted with an intestinal ailment.</p> <p>Insane Delusions\u2014Unfounded Suspicions.\u2014The sanity of the testatrix in this ease being questioned because she suspected that her husband was unfaithful to her, and that he was attempting to poison her and to send her to an insane asylum, the court observed: There is a very large class of people whose sanity is undoubted, who are unduly jealous or suspicious of others, and especially of those closely connected with them, and who upon the most trivial, even whimsical, grounds wrongfully impute the worst motives and conduct to those in whom they ought to confide. This insanity, which is developed in a great variety of forms, is altogether too common, and too many persons confessedly sane are to a greater or less degree afflicted with it, to justify us in saying that because the deceased was so afflicted she was insane, or the victim of an insane delusion.</p> <p>Insane Delusions\u2014Suspicions\u2014Evidence and Burden of Proof.\u2014The line between unfounded and unreasonable suspicions of a sane mind and insane delusions is sometimes quite indistinct and difficult to define. However, the legal presumption is in favor of sanity, and on the issue of sanity or- insanity the burden is upon him who asserts insanity to prove it. Hence, in a doubtful case, unless there appears a preponderance of proof of mental unsoundness, the issue should be found the other way.</p> <p>Insane Delusions\u2014Suspicions\u2014Tests of Insanity.\u2014Suspicion is the imagination of the existence of something, especially something wrong, without proof, or with but slight proof; it is an impression in the mind which has not resulted in a conviction. It is synonymous with doubt, distrust, or mistrust\u2014the mind is in an unsettled condition. Suspicion existing, slight evidence might produce a rational conviction or conclusion; this without evidence, however slight, would be a delusion. Is there evidence, however slight? This is the test.* The suspicion may be illogical or preposterous, but it is not, therefore, evidence of insanity.</p> <p>Insane Delusions\u2014Suspicions as to Husband\u2019s Constancy.\u2014If a . wife has evidence, though slight, on which to base a suspicion of her husband\u2019s unfaithfulness, and has no settled conviction on the subject, her suspicion does not amount to an insane delusion.</p> <p>Insane Delusion\u2014Conspiracy to Confine Wife in Asylum.\u2014The contention in this ease that the testatrix was afflicted with an insane delusion in that she believed her husband conspired to confine her in an insane asylum, was found by the court to be unsupported by the evidence, especially in view of the fact that the husband had twitted her of being crazy and threatened to break her will.</p> <p>\u25a0 Insane Delusions\u2014Testimony of Business Men.\u2014The value of the testimony of business men and acquaintances, acquired in commercial dealings with a person alleged to be the victim of insane delusions, is favorably regarded by the courts, on the issue of insanity.</p> <p>Testamentary Capacity\u2014Inquisition Before Execution of Will.\u2014 The examination by medical experts of a testatrix prior to her execution of her will, for the purpose of determining her testamentary capacity, is discussed by the court, both as a suggestion of insanity, and as a wise precaution.</p> <p>Testamentary Capacity\u2014Will as Evidence.\u2014A will may be considered in proof of its own validity and of the sanity of its maker.</p> <p>Testamentary Capacity\u2014Suspicion of Husband.\u2014If there are causes sufficient to induce a sane woman to ignore her husband in her will, or reduce what otherwise would have been a just allowance, the fact that she entertains an unjust or an unfounded suspicion in regard to his treatment of her, or an unjust prejudice against him, does not affect the will nor demonstrate that she is necessarily of unsound mind.</p> <p>Testamentary Capacity\u2014Test for Determining.\u2014The tests of testamentary capacity are: (1) Understanding of what the testatrix is doing; (2) how she is doing it; (3) knowledge of her property; (4) how she wishes to dispose of it; (5) and who are entitled to her bounty. -</p> <p>Testamentary Capacity\u2014Testimony of Attesting Witnesses.\u2014The testimony of the attesting witnesses, and, next to them, the testimony of those present at the execution of the will, are most to be relied upon in determining the question of testamentary capacity.</p> <p>Testamentary Capacity\u2014Insane Delusions.\u2014In this case the husband of the testatrix contests her will on the ground that she was of unsound mind by reason of being the victim of insane delusions that her husband was unfaithful, that he was trying to poison her, and that he was conspiring to confine her in an insane asylum, but the court finds against the contestant and sustains the will.</p>"}
