Road, between the towns of Greensboro and Charlotte, so as to make it different from that of the other portions of the road; and that such change of gauge would greatly damage the whole State and its citizens, and is in no wise warranted by law.\n\nWherefore plaintiff demands judgment, c., and praying for a perpetual injunction.\n\nJudge Watts granted the restraining order until the hearing, which was had before Judge Albertson, at Spring Term, 1873.\n\nThe defendants appeared and answered, insisting: that the State could not as a plaintiff, maintain an action of this nature. That the North Carolina Railroad, by its charter, was authorized to lease its road and property; and that at the time of making the lease complained of, the State was represented in the meeting, by its Directors, who sanctioned the same, as did also the Directors representing the interest of the private stockholders.\n\nDefendants further said, that they did propose to change the gauge of the North Carolina road, so as to make it harmonize with the tracks of the connecting roads, north and south of the places referred to in the complaint, insisting that such contemplated change would not endamage the State or any of its citizens, but on the contrary, such change would greatly promote the State's interest, and facilitate travel and the transportation of freight from place to place.\n\nUpon the hearing, the defendants moved to vacate the injunction theretofore granted, having given the necessary notice of such motion to the plaintiff.\n\nHis Honor refused the motion, and ordered the injunction to be continued until the hearing, upon the condition that the plaintiff enter into bond in the sum of $50,000, conditioned to pay the defendants all such costs and damages as they may incur by the wrongful suing out of this injunction.\n\nFrom the order continuing the injunction, the defendants appealed.", "procedural_history": "", "scdb_id": "", "sibling_ids": [3671734], "source": "Z", "status": "Published", "suitNature": "", "syllabus": ""}
