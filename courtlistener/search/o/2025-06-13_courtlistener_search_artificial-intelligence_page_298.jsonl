It is sufficient if it expresses the general subject of the act, and all the minor subdivisions germane to the general subject will be held to be included in it.

Criminal law\u2014explosives\u2014manufacture, use, etc.\u2014act of 1887\u2014 of the title, and the subject of the act. The act entitled \u201cAn act to regulate the manufacture, transportation, use and sale of explosives, and to punish an improper use of the same,\u201d approved June 16,1887, is not obnoxious to section 13, article 4, of the constitution, \u201cthat no act hereafter passed shall embrace more than one subject, and that shall be expressed in the title.\u201d The title does not express two subjects, but only one, and all the provisions of the act are within the subject expressed in the title, and are germane to each other and the general scope and purpose of the act.</p> <p>3. The regulation of the use of explosives necessarily implies the right to punish an improper use. Two different subjects are not included or expressed in or by the title, for the punishment of an improper use flows necessarily from the main or substantive object as stated in the title,\u2014i. e., to regulate the use of explosives.</p> <p>4. Same\u2014use of explosives\u2014intent\u2014how shown\u2014possession\u2014declarations, etc. On the trial of one for the manufacture, etc., of explosives with intent to take the life of another, the fact that the accused procured the explosive may be shown by proof that it was found in his possession, and the unlawful intent is manifested by the nature of the substance itself, his concealment of it, and his contemporaneous declarations of his intent.</p> <p>5. Where a person is found in possession of dangerous explosives, and has avowed the\" intention of using them for a particular unlawful purpose, the presumption will arise that he procured the same for such unlawful use, especially when his business does not call for the use or possession of them.</p> <p>6.

Same\u2014possession of dynamite\u2014explanation\u2014an instruction construed\u2014whether excluding evidence offered in defense. On the prosecution of one for the manufacturing, compounding, buying, selling, etc., of dynamite, with intent to destroy human life therewith, under an act-that took effect on July 1,1887, the defendant- asked an instruction that to constitute the crime the acts charged should be shown to have been done after July 1, 1887. The court added this: \u201cTherefore the jury must disregard any evidence as to the making, compounding or procuring dynamite, at G.\u2019s house or elsewhere, prior to said date.\u201d The defendant, to account for dynamite found in his possession, testified that it was left in his house in 1886, by one K.: Held, that the instruction, as modified, was not calculated to take from the consideration of the jury the testimony explaining the defendant\u2019s possession of the-dynamite. The instruction related solely to the elements necessary to-constitute the crime charged, and had no reference to the defense.</p> <p>8. Same\u2014accessory. Under a statute which provides that any person abetting or in any way assisting in certain denounced acts shall be deemed a principal, and upon conviction shall be subject to the same punishment as provided in the preceding sections relating to principals, a defendant, if guilty as an accessory before the fact, is to be indicted and punished as a principal.</p> <p>9. Same\u2014verdict\u2014certainty as to party found guilty. On a separate trial of one of several defendants, the record showed the coming of the People by the State\u2019s attorney, and J. H., (the defendant,) impleaded, etc., and the selection of the jury, and trial. The jury found \u201cthe defendant\u201d guilty, without specifying his name: Held, that the verdict was not uncertain as to the party found guilty.</p> <p>10. Same\u2014place of imprisonment\u2014act of 1887, to regulate manufacture, etc., of explosives\u2014construed. Section 1 of the act of 1887, \u201cto regulate the manufacture, transportation, use and sale of explosives, and to punish an improper use of the same,\u201d provides that any one found guilty of the acts therein denounced \u201cshall be deemed guilty of a felony, and upon conviction thereof shall be punished for a term not less than five years nor more than twenty-five years:\u201d Held, that the imprisonment intended is imprisonment in the penitentiary.</p> <p>11. Witnesses \u2014 competency\u2014religious test. Section 3, article 2, of the State constitution, has abrogated the rule which obtained prior to 1870, restricting the competency of witnesses on account of defect of religious belief, and there is no longer any test of .qualification in respect to religious belief or want of the same which affects the competency of citizens to testify as witnesses in courts of justice.</p> <p>12. Same\u2014former decision. The case of Central Military Tract Railroad Co. v. Rochafelloio, 17 Ill. 511, on the competency of a witness depending upon his religious belief, overruled Noble v. People, Beecher\u2019s Breese, 54; and section 3, article 2, of the constitution, abrogated the .former rule that had obtained in this State, and there is now no religious test as to the competency of any witness.</p> <p>13. Same\u2014credibilily\u2014elements to be considered\u2014detectives\u2014police officers. On the trial of one for crime, there is no error in refusing an instruction asked by the defense, that the evidence of private detectives and the police \u201cshould be received with a large degree of caution.\u201d All the circumstances connected with a witness, or that may tend to affect his credibility or bias his judgment, are competent to be shown, and considered by the jury in determining the weight and credit to be given to his testimony.</p>"}

Chapter 4589 laws, approved May 8th, 1897, entitled: \u201cAn act to abrogate the writ of scire facias ad aMdiendwm errores in appellate proceedings to the Supreme Court, and to provide a substitute therefor in civil causes,\u201d held to be not obnoxious to that provision of the constitutions of the United States and of the State of Florida that forbids the deprivation of property without due i rocess of law. Our Legislature has the power, not only to regulate and prescribe the procedure to obtain in our several courts, respectively, but also to regulate and prescribe the procedure by which causes tried in the courts of first instance shall be transferred for review to other tribunals clothed by the constitution with revisory powers; and when, in so doing, it provides that the issuance and record of a writ of error in the court of first instance shall have the effect of transferring the cause and the litigants therein to the jurisdiction of the revising court for re-examination, it has prescribed that \u201cdue process of law\u201d contemplated by said constitutions. A writ of error proceeding is not such a new and original suit as to require the same strictness and rigidity in the service upon the defendant therein of notice of its institution, as is required at the institution of \u00e1 new and original action in a court of first instance, but is rather a continuation of an original suit; and a statute providing for constructive notice only of its institution and pendency does not violate that provision of the organic law that prohibits the deprivation of property without due process of law. (Mr. Justice Carter dissenting.)</p> <p>2. Nothing 'but a clear violation of the constitution will justify the courts in overruling the legislative will; and where there is a reasonable doubt as to the constitutionality of an act it must be resolved in favor of the act, and it must be upheld.</p> <p>3. A mandamus against a city council is virtually a proceeding against the corporation, and the judgment therein is obligatory on the members of the board of councilmen in office at the time of its rendition, regardless of mutations made, pending the proceedings, in the personnel of those composing such representative council.</p> <p>4. Writs of error should in all cases give the individual names of all parties plaintiff and defendant m error in order that the appellate court may know by the record who the parties are be-tore it. A writ of error issued in the name of \u201cJ- A. et al.\u201d is nothing more than a writ issued in the name of \u201cJ- A.\u201d alone; and where the judgment thus sought to be reviewed i$ a joint one against \u201cJ A.\u201d and other co-judgment defendants who are not otherwise named or designated in the writ of error than by the use therein of the abbreviation \u201cet al.,\u201d such writ is fatally defective for the want of necessary parties plaintiff in error. The settled rule being that all parties defendant to a judgment rendered against them jointly must be made parties to a writ of error instituted for its review.</p> <p>3. A writ of error, amended by bringing into it new parties plaintiff in error, is, as to such new parties, a new writ, issued, at the time of such amendment, for the first time- And this court, according to its established rule, will not permit such amendments to be made after the time limited for suing out writs of error- has expired.</p> <p><5. The provision in Chapter 4329, laws of 1-897, requiring the writ of error to he recorded in the minute-hoolc of the Cvremt Court, is designed as a substitute for the service upon the defendant in error of the abrogated writ of scire facias ad audienclum errores, and serves the purpose of notice to the defendant in error that he and the record of his case have by such writ been removed for review to the appellate court- It is jurisdictional, and must in every ease he strictly complied with. The statute does not, however, preclude waiver of notice and voluntary appearance in the appellate court.</p> <p>7. All original writs of error should be returned to a/nd filed in the appellate court with the record in the cause; or, at latest, by the return day named in the writ; and, in view of the provisions of Chapter 4329, laws of 1897, it should in every case have endorsed upon it when returned a certificate of the Cle-V of the Circuit Court showing the fact that it has been recorded in the minute-hook of the Circuit Court, and the date of such record and the page of the book where recorded; and the transcript of the record should also contain a certified copy of such record of the writ of error, certified by the Clerk of the Circuit Court in the same manner that he authenticates any transcript of any other document of record in his office, having such copy to show also the date of its record in Ms minute-hook.</p>"}

Waters and Watercourses \u2014 Flooding Lands \u2014 Duty of Railroad Company. \u2014 Where a railroad company substitutes a culvert for a trestle on its roadbed, it is its duty to exercise due care not to obstruct the natural flow of the water at seasons of either low or high water; that is to say, it is the duty of the company to provide security against ordinary periodical freshets, which could be foreseen with reasonable certainty.</p> <p>2. Waters and Watercourses \u2014 Flooding Lands \u2014 Duty of Railroad Company \u2014 Case at Bar. \u2014 In the instant case a railroad company substituted a culvert for a trestle upon its roadbed; where' the roadbed crossed a small stream. There was positive evidence that before the construction of the culvert the stream often overflowed its banks, but there was no backwater. It was the contention of the company that it used due care in the construction of the culvert, and had so constructed it as not to obstruct such flows of flood waters as might be reasonably expected to occur; and that its engineers closely followed the formula for a culvert sufficient for the drainage of the area drained by the stream.</p> <p>Held: That plaintiffs contentions with respect to the extent of the backwater on their respective farms, and the damage done, and that this backwater was due to the inadequacy of' the culvert and did not take place under the prior conditions, were fully sustained by the evidence.</p> <p>8. Waters and Watercourses \u2014 Flooding Lands \u2014 Unprecedented Flood \u2014 Act of God \u2014 Case at Bar. \u2014 In an action for flooding lands, defendant contended that the rainfall' at the time of the overflow was of an unprecedented character, and could not have been anticipated in the exercise of ordinary foresight and prudence; in other words, That it was an act of God, against which defendant railroad company was under no obligation to undertake to provide.</p> <p>Held: That the evidence on this point clearly showed that the rain in question was not an unprecedented downpour, but one that from the experience of that locality could reasonably have been expected, and hence was such a rain as the defendant company was compelled to provide against when it undertook to replace a trestle with a culvert.</p> <p>4. Waters and Watercourses \u2014 Flooding Lands \u2014 Continuing Nuisance \u2014 Action for Future as Well as Present. Damages \u2014 Case at Bar. \u2014 In the instant case, an action for the flooding of plaintiffs\u2019 lands due to an insufficient culvert, on defendant railroad\u2019s bed, the inadequacy of the culvert to carry off the high waters of a periodical character likely to occur was established. It was further shown that the inadequacy of the culvert rendered it a perpetual menace to plaintiffs\u2019 properties, and that this menace had materially reduced their market value.</p> <p>Held: That the moment that it was established that the culvert was a perpetual menace to. the properties concerned, an immediate cause of action arose, and the injury not depending upon the use of the culvert, the landowners were under no obligation to bring successive actions for successively recurring damages, but might recover in one action for past and future damages.</p> <p>5. Multiplicity of Suits \u2014 Policy of the Law. \u2014 The general policy of the law is to avoid multiplicity of actions, and,' if practicable, without injustice, to afford compensation in one action for all damages.</p> <p>6. Nuisances \u2014 Continuing Nuisance \u2014 One or Several Actions for Damages. \u2014 The general rule with respect to nuisances undoubtedly is that repeated actions may be brought as long as the nuisance continues, but an exception to the general rule, as well established as the rule itself, is that where a nuisance is permanent, the consequences of which, in the normal course of things, will continue indefinitely, there is but a single action therefor, and the entire damage suffered, both past and future, must be recovered in that action, and the right to recover will be barred unless it is brought within the prescribed number of years from the time the cause of action accrued.</p> <p>Expert and Opinion Evidence \u2014 Admissibility of Opinion Evidence. \u2014 In an action against a railroad company for damages to plaintiff\u2019s lands due to an insufficient culvert causing the periodical flooding of the lands, while the extent of the injurious effect of the culvert upon the value of plaintiffs\u2019 lands is a matter of opinion, still such opinion evidence is not inadmissible. There is much testimony given in court that really, in the ultimate, is merely human judgment or opinion. Absolute certainty is rarely attainable in court proceedings, or conclusions therein reached with the precision and severity of a mathematical demonstration. The law very sensibly allows all the relevant facts and circumstances to be placed before the jury that will aid them to make an intelligent disposition of the issue submitted.</p>"}

{"absolute_url": "/opinion/3487599/naudain-v-coudon/", "attorney": "Albert Constable  (with whom was  W.S. Evans  on the brief), for the appellant.\n\nWe concede the law that, in the case of a competent testator, his knowledge and approval of the contents of the document he has executed as his will is, as a general rule, to be inferred from the fact of its execution, and that, in the absence of evidence tending to impeach such inference as unreliable and unsatisfactory in view of the facts and circumstances of the particular case, the law regards it as\nconclusive. But, as there also stated, it is equally true that, where a testator is of impaired mind, though not incompetent, or circumstances surround the preparation or execution of an alleged will, which excite a well-grounded suspicion that the testator did not really know and approve the contents, the formal execution of the document ceases to be a satisfactory basis for the inference; that the law, in such cases, demands proof beyond the mere act of formal execution, and that direct proof that the deceased clearly understood and fully intended to make that disposition of his property which the document purports to direct, must be furnished by the party propounding it as his will.\n\nIt was not denied in the Court below, nor could it be in the light of the authorities, that the plaintiff had brought forward such a body of evidence as to Mrs. Naudain's capacity, and as to the circumstances attending the preparation and execution of her alleged will, as made a grave question of fact for the jury on the fourth issue. It was a question to be answered by evidence, not by legal presumptions. And this being so, the jury should have been permitted to answer the question unembarrassed by the injection into their deliberations of legal presumptions of knowledge and understanding, as was done by this 9th prayer; inasmuch as the rule of law by which the proponent of a will gets,  prima facie,  the benefit of a legal presumption of knowledge and approval from mere capacity and bare execution, had no application to this case as it stood when the 9th prayer was offered. No doubt, had the evidence been closed when defendant rested, after proving Mrs. Naudain's formal execution of the paper, the rule could have been properly applied. He would then have had a presumption of capacity, and he would also have proved Mrs. Naudain's execution of the paper. The combined effect of capacity as thus established, and the proof of formal execution of the paper, was such as to entitle him to the legal presumption that Mrs. Naudain understood and approved the contents of the document.\nBut this preliminary proof, at that stage of the case, did not shift the  onus  of satisfying the jury under the fourth issue that Mrs. Naudain understood and approved the contents of the document. That  onus  still rested on the defendant, though, through the medium of an unrebutted presumption of capacity and proof of execution, he had succeeded at that stage of the case, in making  prima facie  proof of it. Had the plaintiff called no evidence, this  prima facie  case he had made would have been conclusive. But the plaintiff  did  call evidence, and the effect of that evidence was such as to show, that defendant's  prima  facie  case for establishing Mrs. Naudain's understanding and approval, which rested merely on an unrebutted presumption of capacity and proof of formal execution, was not a  sufficient \ncompliance with the  onus .\n\n(1.) That being so &#8212; plaintiff having brought into the case that body of evidence which we have before described impeaching as unreliable and unsatisfactory in this case, the inference that Mrs. Naudain understood and approved the contents of this alleged will merely because she had executed it &#8212; defendant was compelled, notwithstanding he had at an earlier stage of the case, been apparently entitled to go before the jury resting upon a mere inference as constituting a  prima facie  proof, to bring forward direct, affirmative evidence to the fact. What then is that direct, affirmative evidence which he brings? It is that the night before the paper was executed Nelson Whitaker read it to Mrs. Naudain. This, no doubt was, if true, an important piece of evidence for the defendant in sustaining his burden of proving that Mrs. Naudain really understood and approved the paper. The defendant, however, was not satisfied with its intrinsic probative force as a fact, but sought in this 9th prayer to obtain for it an additional, artificial force beyond what the jury might be disposed to consider its intrinsic value. He, therefore, asks this 9th instruction in which he states this fact together with her capacity and formal execution of the paper and says, not\nthat the jury from those facts may find that Mrs. Naudain knew and understood the contents of the paper but &#8212; that \"then the legal presumption is that she knew and understood the contents of said paper.\" That is to say, the defendant, although he had introduced evidence tending to prove that Mrs. Naudain had the capacity necessary to execute the document, that it was read over to her and that she had executed it, and had done this for the purpose of proving as a fact that Mrs. Naudain did really understand and approve the document, undertook by this instruction, to  substitute  a legal conclusion for an affirmative finding of the fact. But the case had become one where the testatrix's understanding and approval were to be established as a fact, not a legal conclusion, and by direct, affirmative proof, not by mere inference.\n\n(2.) One effect of this 9th instruction was to enable the jury to evade deciding, if they wished to do so, whether Mrs. Naudain did in fact really understand and approve of the contents of the alleged will. No doubt they were told by plaintiff's 4th prayer that the defendant had the burden of satisfying them that Mrs. Naudain understood the contents of the paper, and that unless the jury were so satisfied the verdict must be for the plaintiff on the 4th issue. But they were not told in what manner, or by what evidence. the defendant must satisfy them.\n\n(3.) What conceivable right had defendant to group certain facts which his evidence tended to prove &#8212; ignoring other facts which plaintiff's evidence tended to prove &#8212; and call on the Court to  emphasize them  and not only so, but to say to the jury that, in addition to their intrinsic probative force, the law gave them an artificial force and raised a legal presumption in favor of the truth of the fact they tended to prove?\n\n(4.) The introduction into this prayer of the term legal presumption is altogether misleading. Even if we concede it was proper, which it was not, to instruct the jury that they might infer  the ultimate fact of understanding and approval\n&#8212; in face of the evidence that this lady's mind was most seriously impaired and that suspicious circumstances existed in this case calling loudly for the utmost vigilance &#8212; it was not proper to speak of such inference of fact which the jury might draw, as a legal presumption, which is something the law draws without the aid of a jury.\n\n(5.) Where the case is one of impaired mind in connection with suspicious circumstances, the law is, not only that there is no legal presumption of the testator's understanding and approval but, that the jury  ought not to be permitted to infer  from such facts as are stated in this 9th prayer, such understanding and approval.  Yardly  v.  Cuthbertson,  108 Pa. St. 305; Cuthbertson's Appeal,  97 Pa. St. 171. In most of the cases the suspicious circumstance occurring was that the person preparing the will was the person taking a benefit under it. But the nature  of the circumstances which ought to excite the vigilance of the Court and call upon those who propound it as a will for evidence more than the mere inference to be derived from a mere formal execution, can make no manner of difference.  Tyrrell  v. Painton,  Law Rep. [1894] Probate, 151.\n\n(6.) Whether the reading over of the will did or did not bring home to Mrs. Naudain an intelligent apprehension of this 26th paragraph was an inference which the jurors were entitled to draw or not according to what they believed to be the condition of her mind at the time, the dialect in which that paragraph was expressed, and the manner in which that reading over had taken place.  Fulton  v.  Andrew,  L.R., 7 Eng. and Irish App. 448.\n\n(7.) The prayer fails to negative the suspicious circumstances which had displaced it. If the evidence brought forward by the plaintiff tended to prove that Mrs. Naudain's mind was impaired, and also, that there were circumstances surrounding the preparation and execution of the document, which raised a well-grounded suspicion that it did not express her true will, then the prayer ought to have been submitted to the jury to find whether that suspicion had\nbeen removed. The theory of the prayer is, that the legal presumption, to be established by the finding of the facts stated therein, sustains the  onus  resting upon defendant, consistently with a full conviction on the part of the jurors that every fact, which the plaintiff's evidence had tended to prove, had been established. But that would be absurd, and is contradicted by the language of every authority upon the subject.  Barry  v. Butlin,  Moore, P.C. 482;  Tyrrel  v.  Painton  [1894], Probate, 157;  Ingram  v.  Wyatt,  1 Hagg. 384.John S. Wirt,  for the appellee.\n\nWe concede the principle that knowledge and approval of the contents of an alleged will by the testator are part of the burthen of proof assumed by one who propounds it as a will. This burthen is satisfied,  prima facie,  in the case of a competent testator by proving that he executed it. If this  prima facie \ncase, however, is met by proof to the contrary, then the party propounding the paper must satisfy the tribunal affirmatively that the testator did know and approve of the contents of the will before it can be admitted to probate.  Cleare and Fowler  v. Cleare,  L.R. 1 Probate and Divorce, 655;  Taylor  v. Cresswell,   45 Md. 427 . The 9th prayer of the defendant and the 4th prayer of the plaintiff taken together, we think, exactly conform to the decisions above cited.\n\nThe defendants below did not rest upon the legal presumption as stated in defendants' 9th prayer, but offered affirmative proof that the testatrix did in fact understand the contents of the will, especially the 26th clause thereof, making provision for her husband. Nelson E. Whitaker testifies that Mrs. Naudain understood the instructions she gave him, and that when the will was read over to her the evening before its execution she thoroughly understood it. He states that there was discussion between them as to the provision for her husband, that she understood it and that it was entirely her own suggestion. This statement is made\nagain and again. Here was positive affirmative proof that the testatrix understood the contents of the will, especially the provisions with reference to her husband.\n\nThe whole contention of the plaintiff was that owing to her enfeebled condition Mrs. Naudain could not understand the technical and involved language of clause 26 of the will. But there is no testimony to support this contention which is mere matter of speculation. There is no proof of \"suspicious circumstances,\" and nothing whatever to impeach the testimony of Nelson E. Whitaker, who is very clear in his statements. In the absence of affirmative testimony that Mrs. Naudain did not understand her will the Court will not enter into a discussion of how far she understood and appreciated the meaning and bearings of particular provisions of her will. As was well said by SIR J.P. WILDE in  Atter  v.  Atkinson,  L.R. 1 P.  D. 665, if Courts permitted such discussions they would upset half the wills in the country.", "caseName": "Naudain v.
