Such verdict does not necessarily find a continual withholding of possession, or other facts entitling plaintiff to an injunction.</p> <p>Interference with Judgment rendered by District Court.\u2014When there is no prayer in the complaint for possession, and the District Court directs a judgment for damages alone to be entered for plaintiff, upon a verdict in his favor for damages, in an action for an alleged trespass and ouster with force and arms, and forcible detention of possession, the appellate Court will not reverse the judgment on an appeal upon the judgment roll.</p> <p>Presumption in Favor of a Judgment.\u2014When the judgment gives all the relie! demanded in the complaint, the presumption is that the Court below has entered such a judgment as was required by the facts in issue proved, and the appellate Court will not disturb the judgment, unless it affirmatively appears that the plaintiff is entitled to other relief than that given.</p> <p>Amendment to Prayer of Complaint.\u2014If the Court below refuses to allow the prayer of the complaint to be amended after a verdict for the plaintiff and judgment entered, the presumption is that it acted correctly, and that there were no facts proved to warrant a different judgment than that prayed for. The party asking the amendment should show affirmatively that the facts proved within the issues made will justify a different judgment than that prayed for and given.</p> <p>Prayer.\u2014Section thirty-nine of the Practice Act requires the complaint to contain \"a demand of the relief which the plaintiff claims.\u201d The policy is to require the plaintiff to apprise the party of the extent of the judgment he demands. For this purpose the prayer is sometimes significant.</p> <p>Proofs should Accord with Prayer.\u2014If the relief prayed for is appropriate to the facts alleged, the defendant has a right to assume that the case will be tried in accordance with the theory of the prayer; and where the case is so tried, it would work injustice to allow the prayer for relief to be amended after verdict by inserting a prayer for other and different relief, that might be brought within some of the issues without regard to the question as to whether such issues were actually tried and determined.</p> <p>Amending Prayer after Verdict.\u2014The Court should not allow the prayer for relief to be amended after verdict, so as to ask for further relief, unless the facts averred and issues joined justify it, and all those issues to which the further relief demanded relate have been fully litigated and fairly determined, and the additional relief has been asked in proper time.</p> <p>Relief to be Granted upon Prayer of Complaint.\u2014The granting, after verdict, of greater relief than that prayed for in the complaint, either with or without an amendment of the prayer, is a matter resting in the sound* discretion of the District Court, and the appellate Court will not interfere with that discretion, unless it is made to appear that it has been unsoundly exercised.</p> <p>Different Counts in Complaint.\u2014If the complaint contains two independent counts, each complete within itself, and concluding with its own appropriate prayer for relief, and separately signed by counsel, the prayer to the second count will not be deemed to have any reference to the first, and on a verdict on the first count only, the relief granted will follow the prayer of that couut.</p> <p>Injunction to restrain Trespasses.\u2014The Court will not interfere, hy injunction, to restrain the commission of naked trespasses, where there is no waste committed.</p> <p>Injunction to restrain Diversion of Water. \u2014 A Court of equity will not restrain the diversion of water hy injunction until the party complaining is in a condition to use it. While the dam and canal of the party claiming the water are in process of construction, bub are not yet in a condition to appropriate the water, the use of the water by other parties is no injury, and such use affords no ground for relief, legal or equitable.</p> <p>Adverse Claim to use Water.\u2014A party who is not in the possession of water cannot maintain an action under section two hundred and fifty-four of the Practice Act, to determine an adverse claim to it.</p> <p>Remedy of Party Claiming Water.\u2014If a party claiming water is constructing his dam and canal, but has not yet diverted the water, an action for damages and to recover possession of the dam site and dam, and of the canal site and canal, will afford an adequate remedy for a trespass upon an ouster from the possession of such dam and canal.</p> <p>Demurrer.\u2014If the second count is in part a copy of the first, but the additional allegations it contains do not present any new or additional ground of relief, the second count is redundant, and the judgment will not be reversed because a demurrer to such second count was sustained, for no injury was sustained thereby.</p> <p>Action for Invasion of Water Right.\u2014Until a claimant is himself in a position to use the water, the right to the water does not exist in such a sense as to enable him to maintain an action against another, either to recover the water or damages for its diversion.</p> <p>Distinct Causes of Action.\u2014An entry upon and ouster from a dam site and dam in process of construction, and a canal site and canal in process of construction, and a diversion of water claimed by means of the dam and canal, are two distinct causes of action, which cannot be united in the same -statement of cause of action in a complaint, but should be separately stated.</p> <p>Demurrer for Ambiguity.\u2014A complaint which leaves it in doubt whether the plaintiff sues for a trespass upon and ouster from his dam site aud dam in process of construction, or for a diversion of the water claimed by the plaintiff, is ambiguous, and a demurrer for that reason should be sustained.</p> <p>Error in Favor of Appellant.\u2014A judgment will not be reversed for an error which was in favor of the appellant,</p>"}
