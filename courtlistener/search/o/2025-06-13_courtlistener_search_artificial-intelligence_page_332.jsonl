Taxation\u2014legislative power over, in general. The right to tax, which, from necessity, is inherent in every government, with us is vested in the legislature, which possesses plenary power over the subject, except so far as it is restricted by the constitution of the State or that of the United States.</p> <p>2. Same\u2014constitutionality of the law of 1872 for taxing railroad corporations. The third section of the consolidated revenue act of 1872, requiring that the capital stock of all companies and associations then or thereafter created under the laws of this State, shall be so valued by the State Board of Equalization as to ascertain and determine, respectively, the fair cash value of such capital stock, including the franchise, over and above the assessed value of the tangible property of such company or association, being a general law, and uniform as to the class upon which it operates,, is not in violation of any constitutional provision.</p> <p>8. Constitutional law\u2014taxation of corporations. Section 1, article 9, of the new constitution, does not require that the legislature, in providing for the taxation of corporations, to designate the precise amount which each corporation shall pay, and that this shall be the same on each corporation, without regard to the value of the franchise or the privileges enjoyed, nor that such taxation shall be of like character with that which may be imposed on inn-keepers, and others pursuing the particular vocations named.</p> <p>4. This part of the constitution only requires that corporations shall be taxed in such manner as the General Assembly shall, from time to time, direct by general law, and the only uniformity required is as to the class upon which such general law shall operate. Its design was, to enable the legislature to make the burthen of taxation proportionate, by applying a different rule to corporations and the vocations named from that applied to individuals.</p> <p>5. Same\u2014mode of taxing corporations discretionary with the legislature. It is therefore discretionary with the legislature to determine whether corporations shall be taxed only on their tangible property, on the amount of their capital stock paid in, on the amount of their gross receipts, or, as under the act of 1873, on the value of their tangible property and on the fair cash value of their capital stock, including their franchise, over and above the assessed value of their tangible property, subject merely to the limitation that it shall be directed by general law, uniform as to the class upon which it operates.</p> <p>6. Same\u2014assessment of property may he given to different officers. There is no constitutional provision which either expressly or by necessary implication denies the legislature the power'to commit the valuation of property for taxation to such person or persons as it, in its wisdom, may select. It is competent to require the State Board of Equalization to assess the value of a certain class of property, leaving other property to be assessed by the ordinary assessors.</p> <p>7. Same\u2014whether power given Board of Equalization is a delegation of legislative power. The power given to the State Board of Equalization to \u201cadopt such rules and principles for ascertaining the fair cash value of the capital stock of corporations as to it may seem equitable and just,\u201d is not a delegation of legislative power, and does not therefore render the act unconstitutional. Ho discretion is left to the board as to what shall be assessed or what degree of value shall be ascertained. Without such expression, the board would have this power by necessary implication from the power to assess.</p> <p>8. Statute\u2014rule of construction. A statute should be so construed that the whole, if possible, shall stand, and when it can he so construed and applied as to avoid a conflict with the constitution, such construction must be adopted.</p> <p>9. Corporations\u2014capital stock distinguished from shares of stock. The legal property of the shareholder in a corporation is quite distinct from that of the corporation, although the shares of stock have no value save that which they derive from the corporate property and franchise; and a tax levied upon the property of the one is not, in any legal sense, levied upon the property of the other. A tax upon the capital stock and franchise of a corporation is not a tax upon the shares of the shareholders.</p> <p>10. Same\u2014distinction further explained. The interest of a shareholder in a corporation entitles him to participate in the net profits of the corporation in the employment of its capital, during the existence of its charter, in proportion to the number of his shares, and, upon its dissolution or termination, to his proportion of the property that may remain of the corporation after the payment of its debts. This is a distinct, independent interest or property, held by the shareholder like any other property belonging to him. But the capital stock and other property of the corporation is a distinct legal interest, and is taxable to the corporation itself. 1</p> <p>11. Same \u2014franchise is property. A franchise of a corporation is property, and as such is liable to taxation, as well as the capital stock and tangible property of the corporation. The franchise may also be condemned for public use, under the right of eminent domain, upon due compensation being made.</p> <p>12. The fact that it is diflicult to fix a true value upon a franchise, and the danger of doing injustice in attempting to tax it, furnishes no objection to the right of the State to tax it, as no other species of property can escape taxation on account of the difficulty of ascertaining its value. Absolute accuracy jn assessment of property is not essential to the validity of taxes based on it.</p> <p>13. Same\u2014capital stock is tamable but not shares. Under the revenue act of 1872, the capital stock of corporations created under the laws of this State must be taxed, and the shares of stock are exempted from taxation ; but when a resident of this State owns shares of stock in a corporation created by the laws of another State, they are taxable against him.</p> <p>14. The words \u201ccapital stock,\u201d as used in the act of 1872, do not mean \u201cshares of stock,\u201d either separately or in the aggregate, but are intended to designate the property of the corporation subject to taxation.</p> <p>15. The fact, that a railway company is required to furnish the Auditor a statement for the use of the State Board of Equalization, showing the amount of their capital, the amount paid in, its value, and the amount of its indebtedness, does not show that the legislature intended to tax the shares of stock. This statement is intended to furnish a mode of measuring the value of the capital stock and franchise.</p> <p>16. Taxation\u2014corporation not taxable on, debts owing by it. A corporation is not taxable upon the value of the debts it owes, and to assess a corporation on the amount of its debts by the State Board of Equalization would be a clear violation of law.</p> <p>17. Same\u2014evidence of assessment including debts of corporation. It was urged, on bill to enjoin the collection of a tax, by a railway company, that the Board of Equalization had included in the assessment of its capital stock, including the franchise, debts which the company owed. The evidence of this was the resolution of the board, declaring that the market or fair cash value of the shares of capital stock, and the market or fair cash value of the debt, excluding indebtedness for current expenses, should be added together, and the aggregate should be taken as the value of the capital stock, including the franchise: Held, that it could not be presumed, from the resolution, that the company was assessed with the amount of its debts, but that it would be regarded as adopting a mode by which to approximate the value of the capital stock, including the franchise.</p> <p>18. Same\u2014courts can not relieve against excessive valuation. The courts have no power to grant relief against the collection of a tax on the ground that the officers appointed by law to assess erred in the valuation of property. In fixing the value of property for taxation, the assessors or Board of Equalization act judicially, and their decision can only be impeached for fraud.</p> <p>19. Same\u2014assessment by recommendation of a committee. It was objected to an assessment of the property of a railway company, that the valuation was determined by a committee of the State Board of Equalization; but it was held, that as the report of the committee was acted upon and adopted by the board, it was to be regarded as having been made by the board.</p> <p>20. Same\u2014no notice of assessment required. It is not required that a corporation, whose property is assessed for taxation by the State Board of Equalization, shall be notified of the assessment or the rules adopted whereby to determine the value of the property, and no right of appeal is given from the assessment.</p> <p>21. Same\u2014excessive levy may be emyoined. Where the State tax is limited to a given sum, a levy upon property in excess of the proportionate amount necessary to be levied on it to produce the given sum, such excess is unauthorized by law, and its collection will be enjoined.</p> <p>22. Injunction\u2014of the collection of a torn. A court of equity will not entertain a bill to restrain the collection of a tax, except in cases where the tax is unauthorized by law, or where it is assessed upon property not subject to taxation, or where the property has been fraudulently assessed at too high a rate. In no event will an injunction lie, unless it is clearly made to appear that the party has been wrongfully assessed, and will sustain irreparable injury unless the collection of the tax be enjoined.</p>"}

Charitable bequests \u2014 Case at bar. \u2014 Testator, in 1880, bequeathed money to be invested by a fiduciary, giving ample security, in safe interest-bearing funds, the interest only to be applied to the use of his legatee during her life, and at her death, \u201cthe principal and any unex-pended interest to be paid to the trustees of the Protestant Episcopal Education Society of Virginia\u201d (incorporated in 1875), \u201csaid bequest to be used exclusively for educating poor young men for the Episcopal ministry, upon the basis of evangelical principles as now established.\u201d</p> <p>Held :</p> <p>1. The bequest to the legatee corporation is not null and void, because not absolute for its own use as a corporate body, but in trust to be exclusively used for the trusts therein named, and because those trusts are religious in their character, and too vague and indefinite to be upheld under the law of this State, or to be administered by a court of chancery, even if merely educational as contemplated by Code 1873, chap. 77, sec. 2.</p> <p>2. The bequest is not contrary to public policy, but is valid both at common law and under Code 1873, chap. 77, and is enforceable by the chancery courts of this State.</p> <p>2. Corporations \u2014 Trustees.\u2014-Corporations may take and hold estates for the use of another, if not for purposes foreign to the objects of their creation; and a devise or bequest to a corporation in trust, if otherwise valid, is not for that reason, void.</p> <p>S. Trusts \u2014 Express\u25a0\u2014Implied.\u2014Where in the nature of things, a trust is created, it is immaterial that it is not expressly declared in terms.</p> <p>4. Charities \u2014 Definition.\u2014In a legal sense, a charity is a gift to be applied, consistently with the laws, for the purpose of benefiting an indefinite number of persons in any respect whatever, and it is not material that the purpose should be expressly designated as charitable.</p> <p>5. Religious uses \u2014 Public policy. \u2014 -As exhibited by the legislation of this State, there has never been any hostility here to bequests for religious uses. See Code 1873, chapters 75 and 77.</p> <p>6. Idem \u2014 Idem.\u2014This court has never decided that bequests for religious uses were void, for that reason alone. See Gallego v. Attorney- General, 3 Leigh, 450.</p> <p>7. Equitable jurisdiction and relief \u2014 Charitable uses \u2014 Common law\u2014 43 Elizabeth \u2014 Act of iSjp. \u2014 At common law chancery courts had jurisdiction to enforce bequests for charitable uses. Statute of 43 Elizabeth did not confer such jurisdiction, but only created an auxiliary remedy by commission, &c. Said statute was local, and never in force here. But if it was general in its operation in some respects, it was not repealed by the Act of 1792, but in those respects was preserved by the saving clause of that act. In any event, the Act of 1839, (Code 1873, chap. 77,) clearly validates and makes enforceable all gifts for such purposes, subject to certain restrictions therein contained.</p> <p>8.
