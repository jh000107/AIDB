{"absolute_url": "/opinion/3554267/golden-v-national-utilities-co/", "attorney": "Clark, Boggs, Peterson  Becker, Howard B. Lang, Jr.,  and William L. Nelson, Jr.,  for appellant.\n\n(1) The only evidence in the record to support a finding of causal connection between any act or omission of the appellant and the explosion was the opinion of the expert witness Alfred Benberg which was incompetent and inadmissible. State ex rel. Kansas City So. Ry. Co. v. Shain,  340 Mo. 1195 , 105 S.W.2d 915 ; Dunn v. Alton R. Co.,  340 Mo. 1037 ,  104 S.W.2d 311 ; Boyd v. Logan Jones Dry Goods Co.,  340 Mo. 1100 , 104 S.W.2d 348; Iman v. Walter Freund\nBread Co.,  332 Mo. 461 ,  58 S.W.2d 477 ; Sisk v. Chicago, B. \nQ.R. Co., 67 S.W.2d 830. (2) If it be conceded for the sake of argument that the record discloses the explosion was caused by gas escaping from appellant's line, still the record, discloses no actual knowledge on the part of appellant and no facts which would charge it with constructive knowledge that gas was escaping into respondent's basement and without such knowledge it cannot be charged with negligence. Monsour v. Excelsior Tobacco Co., 115 S.W.2d 219; Messmer v. St. Louis County Gas Co., 42 S.W.2d 963; 38 Am. Jur., sec. 23, p. 665; Stephens v. Kansas City Gas Co.,  191 S.W.2d 601 . (3) The court erred in permitting the witness, Alfred Benberg, to express his opinion of the cause of the explosion in response to the hypothetical question. The answer of this witness was inadmissible because the witness was not competent to express an opinion upon the cause of the explosion. Stephens v. Kansas City Gas Co.,  191 S.W.2d 601 ; Robison v. Chicago Great Western R. Co., 66 S.W.2d 180; Bebout v. Kurn,  348 Mo. 501 ,  154 S.W.2d 120 ; Graney v. St. L., I.M. \nS. Ry. Co.,  157 Mo. 666 . (4) The opinion of the witness is not based upon the facts or adequate data but is a mere guess, conjecture, and speculation. Vitale v. Duerbeck,  338 Mo. 556 , 92 S.W.2d 691 ; Stephens v. Kansas City Gas Co., 191 S.W.2d l.c. 607; Graney v. St. L., I.M. and S. Ry. Co.,  157 Mo. 666 ; Hardwick v. Kansas City Gas Co.,  195 S.W.2d 504 . (5) The question on which the witness expressed an opinion is not a subject for expert opinion because upon the facts before the witness and to which his opinion was limited he was in no better position to express an opinion than were the jurors. Stephens v. Kansas City Gas Co.,  191 S.W.2d 601 ; Cole v. Uhlmann Grain Co.,  340 Mo. 277 ,  100 S.W.2d 311 ; Bebout v. Kurn,  348 Mo. 501 , 154 S.W.2d 120 . (6) The question omitted undisputed material facts. De Donato v. Wells,  328 Mo. 448 ,  41 S.W.2d 184 , 82 A.L.R. 1331; Hahn v. Hammerstein,  272 Mo. 248 , 198 S.W. 833. (7) The question did not present facts sufficient to entitle the witness to express an opinion as to the cause of the explosion. Stephens v. Kansas City Gas Co.,  191 S.W.2d 601 . (8) The question erroneously limited the witness to facts which dictated his answer. De Donato v. Wells,  328 Mo. 448 ,  41 S.W.2d 184 . (9) The answer of the witness is in conflict with undisputed physical facts shown in the record and must be disregarded for that reason. State ex rel. Kansas City So. Ry. Co. v. Shain, 340 Mo. 1195 ,  105 S.W.2d 915 ; Dunn v. Alton R. Co.,  340 Mo. 1037 , 104 S.W.2d 311 ; Graney v. St. L., I.M.  S. Ry. Co., 157 Mo. 666 . (10) The court erred in giving plaintiff's Instruction A-1 because the instruction erroneously permits a recovery on the theory that gas had been escaping from the holes in the pipe into the basement in time for the respondent to have found it and corrected it but had negligently failed to do so. This negligence was neither pleaded nor proved. (11)\nThe instruction gives the jury a roving commission to find leaks in the valves, pipes, and conduits of the gas line and a roving commission to find negligence. Grimes v. Red Line Service, 337 Mo. 743 ,  85 S.W.2d 767 ; Watts v. Moussette,  337 Mo. 533 , 85 S.W.2d 487 . (12) The instruction assumes negligence on the part of the defendant. (13) The instruction erroneously instructed the jury on the degree of care required by appellant and did not define negligence. Magrane v. St. Louis  Suburban Ry. Co.,  183 Mo. 119 ; Stewart v. St. Louis Public Serv. Co., 75 S.W.2d 634. (14) The court erred in giving Instruction A-3 because it is indefinite, affords no guide to the jury and indicates the approval of a $10,000 verdict by the court. Grubbs v. Kansas City Public Service Co.,  329 Mo. 390 ,  45 S.W.2d 71 ; Bond v. St. Louis S.F. Ry. Co.,  315 Mo. 987 , 1007,  288 S.W. 777 .\n\n Errol Joyce  and  Walter A. Raymond  for respondent.\n\n(1) The opinion evidence of the respondent's expert witness, Alfred Benberg, was competent and admissible. Such opinion evidence was supplementary to the factual evidence in the case which showed no other possible cause. Hardin v. Illinois Central R. Co.,  334 Mo. 1169 ,  70 S.W.2d 1075 ; Conduit v. Trenton Gas \nElectric Co.,  326 Mo. 123 ,  31 S.W.2d 21 ; James v. Bailey Reynolds Chandelier Co.,  325 Mo. 1054 ,  30 S.W.2d 118 ; Van Brock v. First Natl. Bank in St. Louis,  349 Mo. 425 , 161 S.W.2d 258 ; Guthrie v. City of St. Charles,  347 Mo. 1175 , 152 S.W.2d 91 ; Hardwick v. Kansas City Gas Co.,  195 S.W.2d 504 . (2) Appellant was charged with constructive notice that its pipes were old, rusty, corroded and were leaking gas which was likely to find its way into respondent's basement and cause an explosion. Gray v. Kurn,  345 Mo. 1027 ,  137 S.W.2d 558 ; Nomath Hotel Co. v. Kansas City Gas Co.,  300 Mo. 240 ,  253 S.W. 975 ; Weed v. American Car  Foundry Co.,  322 Mo. 127 ,  14 S.W.2d 652 . (3) The opinion evidence of the expert witness, Alfred Benberg, as to the cause of the explosion given in answer to the hypothetical question was properly admitted and does not constitute reversible error. De Donato v. Wells,  328 Mo. 448 ,  41 S.W.2d 184 . (4) The claim Mr. Benberg was not qualified to express an opinion upon the cause of the explosion was not preserved by objection below and is lacking in merit also. Fair Mercantile Co. v. St. Paul Fire  Marine Ins. Co.,  237 Mo. App. 511 ,  175 S.W.2d 930 ; Stephens v. Kansas City Gas Co.,  191 S.W.2d 601 ; James v. Bailey Reynolds Chandelier Co.,  325 Mo. 1054 ,  30 S.W.2d 118 . (5) The opinion of the expert witness Alfred Benberg was based upon sufficient facts and adequate data to constitute substantial evidence. Stephens v. Kansas City Gas Co.,  191 S.W.2d 601 ; Hardwick v. Kansas City Gas Co.,  195 S.W.2d 504 ; Orr v. Shell Oil Co.,  352 Mo. 288 , 177\n87 S.W.2d 608; Jones v. Chicago, B.  Q.R. Co.,  343 Mo. 1104 , 125 S.W.2d 5 ; Evans v. Partlow,  322 Mo. 11 ,  16 S.W.2d 212 ; Dillard v. East St. Louis Ry. Co., 150 S.W.2d 552; Sconce v. Jones,  343 Mo. 362 ,  121 S.W.2d 777 . (6) The source and cause of this explosion presented a situation too involved and complicated for the ordinary juror. Therefore expert testimony was properly admitted. Stephens v. Kansas City Gas Co., 191 S.W.2d 601 ; Hardwick v. Kansas City Gas Co.,  195 S.W.2d 504 ; Fair Mercantile Co. v. St. Paul Fire  Marine Ins. Co., 175 S.W.2d 930 ; Pickett v. Cooper,  192 S.W.2d 412 ; Fields v. Luck, 335 Mo. 765 ,  74 S.W.2d 35 ; (7) No prejudicial error was committed in omitting the facts complained of. Morton v. St. Louis-S.F. Ry. Co.,  323 Mo. 929 ,  20 S.W.2d 34 ; Zellar v. Wolff-Wilson Drug Co., 51 S.W.2d 881; Holton v. Cochran, 208 Mo. 314 , 106 S.W. 1035; Krug v. Mutual Life Ins. Co. of New York, 235 Mo. App. 1224 ,  149 S.W.2d 393 . (8) The question did present facts sufficient to entitle Mr. Benberg to express an opinion as to the cause of the explosion. (9) The hypothetical question did not unduly limit the facts which Mr. Benberg might consider in answering the question. De Donato v. Wells, 328 Mo. 448 ,  41 S.W.2d 184 ; State ex rel. Randall v. Shain, 341 Mo. 201 ,  108 S.W.2d 122 ; Pevesdorf v. Union Electric L.  P. Co., 333 Mo. 1155 ,  64 S.W.2d 939 . (10) The answer of Mr. Benberg is not in conflict with undisputed physical facts. Arnold v. Alton R. Co.,  343 Mo. 1049 ,  124 S.W.2d 1092 ; Morris v. E.I. DuPont De Nemours  Co.,  341 Mo. 821 ,  109 S.W.2d 1222 . (11) Plaintiff's Instruction A-1 was a correct instruction and was properly given. This instruction properly submitted the issue of notice. Barraickman v. National Utilities Co., 191 S.W.2d 265; Berberet v. Electric Park Amusement Co.,  319 Mo. 275 , 3 S.W.2d 1025 ; Simmons v. Kansas City Hockey Club,  334 Mo. 99 , 66 S.W.2d 119 ; Ford v.
