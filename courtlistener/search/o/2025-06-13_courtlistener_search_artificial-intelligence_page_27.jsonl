On appeal, this court agreed with the defendant that the trial court had a duty to conduct such an inquiry when the issue was brought to that court's attention in a motion to dismiss counsel and during the defendant's sentencing hearing. This court also concluded, however, that the record was insufficient to deter- mine whether the defendant's claim had merit and, therefore, remanded the case to the trial court for it to determine whether defense counsel had such a conflict and, if so, whether that conflict adversely affected her representation of the defendant. In light of that remand order, this court declined to reach the defendant's additional claim that the trial court had improperly admitted the testimony of three lay witnesses identifying the defendant in surveillance video footage from a store near the crime scene. The footage depicted, inter alia, two men, with their faces visible, approaching and entering the store together before the victim's murder. Additional footage from a different camera angle depicted the backs of two men, dressed similar to those in the other footage, making their way to, and then standing at, the intersection where the murder occurred. Subsequent footage showed one of the men attacking the other man and then running down the street toward the direction of the store. On remand, the trial court, following a hearing at which the defendant and defense counsel testified, determined that the defendant did not timely raise his conflict of interest claim and that, even if he had done so, he failed to establish that defense counsel was burdened by an actual conflict of interest that adversely affected her performance. After the case returned to this court, the defendant chal- lenged the trial court's determination concerning counsel's alleged con- flict of interest, and this court addressed the defendant's evidentiary claim. Held: 1. The trial court correctly concluded that defense counsel's prior representa- tion of D did not create an actual conflict of interest that adversely affected her representation of the defendant: even if this court assumed that the defendant's conflict of interest claim was timely, there was no evidence that the defendant's and defense counsel's interests ever diverged with respect to any material factual or legal issue, or with respect to a course of action, or that counsel's representation of the defendant was otherwise impaired as a result of her loyalty to D; more- over, the trial court credited counsel's testimony that, during her repre- sentation of D, she learned nothing that she was prevented from using in her defense of the defendant and that the strategies and tactics she employed at trial were entirely unencumbered and uninfluenced by anything relating to her representation of D, and that court's factual findings, including that defense counsel's brief representation of D had no effect on the course of the defendant's trial, were not clearly errone- ous; furthermore, there was no merit to the defendant's contention that an attorney's prior representation of a relative of the victim in a criminal case creates a per se conflict of interest. 2. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony of three lay witnesses identifying the defendant in surveillance video foot- age: pursuant to the rule recently established in State v. Gore (343 Conn. 129), lay opinion testimony concerning the identification of a criminal defendant depicted in a surveillance video is admissible if, in accordance with the provision (\u00a7 7-1) of the Code of Evidence governing the admissi- bility of lay opinion testimony, it is rationally based on the perception of the witness and is helpful to a clear understanding of that witness' testimony or the determination of a fact in issue; moreover, such testi- mony meets the requirements of \u00a7 7-1 if, in light of the totality of the circumstances, there is some basis for concluding that the witness is more likely than the jury to correctly identify the defendant from the footage; in the present case, the totality of the circumstances favored admission of the challenged testimony, as it was undisputed that all three witnesses were sufficiently familiar with the defendant, and, although the defendant was not wearing a disguise during the commission of the murder and the record did not indicate whether the defendant's appearance had changed between the time the surveillance video footage was recorded and the time of trial, the quality of the video weighed in favor of admission of the challenged testimony, as the subject in the video was wearing a hat pulled down over his ears and a winter jacket, and, at certain angles, his face was obscured by either the dark lighting or his movements; accordingly, this court could not conclude that the witnesses, all of whom knew the defendant exceedingly well, could be of no assistance to or were no better suited than the jury in identifying the defendant in the surveillance video footage. 3. The defendant could not prevail on his claim that it would be improper for this court to apply Gore retroactively to this case because Gore was decided on the basis of policy considerations rather than on constitu- tional grounds: judicial decisions generally apply retroactively to pend- ing cases, and this court's application of the rule set forth in Gore did not give rise to any of the concerns highlighted in Neyland v. Board of Education (195 Conn. 174), which established the test for determining whether a judicial decision should be applied prospectively only, because, although Gore established a new principle of law by overruling past precedent holding that the rule limiting lay opinion testimony on the ultimate issue precludes the admission of lay opinion testimony identifying a defendant in video surveillance footage when that identifi- cation embraces an ultimate issue, the defendant did not argue or demon- strate that he relied to his detriment on one legal standard over another during the events underlying this case, the underlying trial, or in bringing the present appeal, despite being afforded an opportunity to do so in the supplemental briefing ordered by this court to address the applicabil- ity of Gore to this case; moreover, the result in this appeal would have been the same under the pre-Gore rule in view of the witnesses' strong familiarity with the defendant and the fact that their testimony did not address the ultimate issue in this case insofar as the witnesses did not identify the defendant from the video surveillance footage depicting the attack but identified the defendant in footage placing him near the crime scene at or around the time of the attack.
