Common cabbtebs\u2014railroad corporations, subject to the laws governing. A railroad company is chartered, and is chartered solely, for the purpose of exercising the functions and performing the duties of a common carrier. The grant in its charter is clearly nothing more than that the corporation shall have the same right of establishing tolls that a natural person has when acting as a common carrier,\u2014a right to be exercised within the same limitations that the common law, in behalf of justice and public policy, imposes upon the natural man.</p> <p>2. Same\u2014implied limitations upon charter powers of railroad corporations\u2014unreasonable rates and unjust discriminations. The rule forbidding unreasonable charges and unjust discriminations, being a common law rule, railroad companies, by accepting their charters, take them with this implied limitation upon the power granted in general terms, to establish their rates of freight. Such charters are granted for the purpose of furnishing improved means of transportation and travel to all persons alike, without unjust discrimination between individuals or communities, and when accepted it is with the knowledge that the nature of the grant imposes these obligations.</p> <p>3. Constitutional law\u2014legislative control over railroad corporations. Even conceding that the charters of railroad companies are contracts, the constitutional power of the legislature to prohibit unjust discrimination in freights still exists, and rests in the right of the legislature to prescribe the methods by which to enforce a common law duty that such companies voluntarily assume when they exercise the functions of a common carrier. Such legislation is in no respect a violation of their charters. '</p> <p>4. Railroads\u2014to/iai is unjust discrimination. The establishment permanently of less rates of freight at points of competition with other roads than is fixed at other places for the same distance, can not be justified by showing that the rates charged at such other, places are reasonably low, and that the rates charged at competing points are unreasonably low. Even if the higher rates are reasonably low, when regarded with reference to the profit upon the capital invested in the road, they are not reasonable in the true sense of the term, if no satisfactory reason can be given for charging less rates for the same or greater services to persons at other stations. Such corporations should not use their power to benefit particular individuals or build up particular localities by arbitrary discriminations in their favor that must cause injury to other persons or places engaged in rival pursuits, or occupying rival positions,</p> <p>5. Same\u2014constitutional provision as to discriminations. Sec. 15, art. 11, of the new constitution, which provides that \u201c the' general assembly shall pass laws to correct abuses and prevent unjust discrimination and extortion in the rates of freight and passenger tariffs on the different roads,\u201d etc., is a recognition of the fact that there may be discriminations which are not unjust, and by implication it restrains the power of the legislature to a prohibition of those which are unjust.</p> <p>6. Constitutional law\u2014law making a certain act that may be innocent, conclusive evidence of guilt. An act of the legislature which forbids any discriminations whatever, under any circumstances, whether just or unjust, in charges for transporting the same class of freight over equal distances, even though moving in opposite directions, and does not permit the companies to show that the discrimination is not unjust, but infers guilt as a conclusive presumption from the mere fact of a difference of rates, without any opportunity of rebutting such presumption, is in violation of the spirit, if not the letter, of the constitutional provisions for the protection of life, liberty and property, and which guarantees the right of trial by jury, and which gives the right in all criminal prosecutions to appear and defend in person and by counsel.</p> <p>7. The legislature can not raise a conclusive presumption of guilt against a natural person from an act that may be innocent in itself, and thereby take from him the privilege of showing the actual innocence or propriety of the act, and confiscate his property as a penalty for the supposed offense.</p> <p>8. Same\u2014excessive penalty. An act of the legislature making any discrimination on the part of railroad companies in their charges for freight a penal offense, and providing for a forfeiture of all their franchises for any wilful violation of the act, without any other penalty for the first offense, is in violation of the spirit of the constitutional provision which requires all penalties to be proportioned to the nature of the offense, and also of sec. 15 of art. 11, under which such a law is framed, which only authorizes the penalty to extend to forfeiture of franchises and property \u201c when necessary for that purpose.\"</p> <p>9. Same\u2014what legislation, in respect to railroad discriminations, would he proper and constitutional. An act prohibiting railroad companies from making any unjust discriminations in their charges for transporting freights, making the charging of a greater compensation for a less distance or for the same distance merely prima facie evidence of unjust discrimination, instead of conclusive evidence, and giving such companies the right of trial by jury, not only of the fact of discrimination, but also upon the issue whether such discrimination is just or not, is within the unquestionable power of the legislature and would be subject to no constitutional objection.</p> <p>10.

A law admitting of but one penalty, and that of the harshest possible character, will be subjected by the courts to close criticism and to a strict construction.</p>"}

Swedlund, 1937,  58 Idaho 209 ,  71 P.2d 434 .\n\nSenate Joint Resolution No. 1 was not an \"act\", \"bill\", or \"statute\", and for that reason its enactment was not subject to the ordinary rules of law concerning statutes and their enactment. The court may search the record to find what the Legislature agreed to and what it proposed for\nsubmission to the people as an amendment to the Constitution. State ex rel. Morris v.

Hays, 1897,  5 Idaho 154 ,  159 ,  47 P. 732 ; McBee v.

J.S., Constitutional Law, &#167;&#167; 15 and 16, page 51.\n\nThe omission of the words \"state auditor\" from the enrolled resolution (Exhibit \"G\") did not occur pursuant to any act of the Legislature, but rather was a result of clerical inadvertence. As such, its omission was not agreed to by the Legislature. The proposition agreed to by the two houses is fairly stated in Sec. 2 of the Resolution. Exhibits \"A\" through \"G\"; Constitutional Prohibitory Amendment, 1881,  24 Kan. 700 ; State ex rel. Morris v. Secretary of State, 1891, 43 La. Ann. 590, 9 So. 776; Revels v. De Goyler, 1948, Fla.,  33 So.2d 719 , 720 .\n\nThe word \"amendment\" in a constitutional provision that two or more amendments \"shall be so submitted as that each amendment shall be voted on separately\" means a proposal of changes in a particular subject, such as the constitutional executive officers. Hillman v. Stockett, 1944,  183 Md. 641 , 39 A.2d 803 ,  808 .\n\nThe proposition submitted related to but one subject matter. There was only one distinct and separate purpose. Mundell v.
