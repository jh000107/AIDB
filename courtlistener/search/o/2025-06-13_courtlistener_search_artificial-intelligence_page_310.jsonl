Absence of Consent of Gas Company to Rate Prescribed not Denial of Protection of Law.</p> <p>A municipal ordinance, fixing for five years a maximum rate for gas is a regulation of property clothed with a public interest, and, though without the consent of the gas company, it does not deny the equal protection of the law and due process of law, if the rate prescribed has and will produce an adequate return to the gas company.</p> <p>7. Fair Test of Rate Prerequisite to Restraining Imposition of New Rate.</p> <p>Courts will decline to interfere by injunction with rate making legislation before a fair test is made; if the rate should subsequently appear to be confiscatory it will be soon enough for the courts to afford a remedy.</p> <p>[Syllabus approved by the court.]</p>"}
