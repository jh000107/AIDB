TJse of Water: Doctrine oe Civil Daw: Prior Appropriation: Beneficial, Use: Territory: Taws in Force in Louisiana Purchase. The doctrine of the civil law with respect to the right of acquiring' an interest in the use of wuiov by prior appropriation and the application thereof to a. beneficial use has never become, a part of the laws of this state, and this without regard to whether the doctrine was ever in existence as a part of the laws in force in the territory acquired by tbe United States known as the Louisiana Purchase.</p> <p>2. Common Law: Rights oe Riparian Proprietors. The common-law rule with respect to the rights of private riparian proprietors has been a part of the laws of the state ever since the organization of a state government.</p> <p>Syllabus by court; catch-words by editor.</p> <p>3. Applicability of Common-Law Rule. It can not be said that the common-law rule defining the rights of riparian proprietors is inapplicable to the conditions prevailing in the stale because irrigation is found essential to successful agriculture in some portions thereof.</p> <p>4. Riparian\u2019s Right: Flow oe Stream: Part and Parcel op Land: Pi\u00edopertv Right: Protection. A riparian\u2019s right to the use of the flow of the stream passing- through or by his land, is a right inseparably annexed to' the soil, not as an casement or appurtenance, bnt as a. part and parcel of the land; such right being a property right, and entitled to protection as such, the same as private property rights generally.</p> <p>5. Rights of Riparian Owners: Vested Rights: Power oe Leoisla-ture to Abolish: Right oe Eminent Domain. The legislature has not abolished, nor does it i>ossess the power to abolish, the rights of riparian proprietors which have become vested, except as such rights he taken or impaired for a public use in an exercise of the powers of eminent domain, for which compensation must be made for the injury sustained.</p> <p>0. Condemnation: Constitution: Statute: Natural Stream: Riparian Proprietor. The provisions of section 41, article 2, chax> ter 93a, Compiled Statutes, 1901 (section 6795, Annotated Statutes), and of section SI. article 1, of the constitution, authorize the condemnation of the right of a private riparian proprietor to the use and enjoyment of a natural stream flowing past his land, or its impairment by an appropriation of such water for irrigation purposes; and such riparian proprietor may recover damages in the same way and subject to the same rules as a person whose propertjr is afEected injuriously by the construction and operation of a railroad.</p> <p>7. Irrigation Act: Public Use: Riparian Owner: Injury: Compensation: Suitable Action. The. irrigation act of 3895 authorizes and regulates the appropriation of the waters of the state for irrigation and other purposes which are declared to be a public use; and in making axrropriations of water as contemplated by the act, a rix>arian owner whose proxierty rights are ai>i>roprialed or impaired is entitled to compensation for the injuries actually sustained, to be recovered in a suitable action or proceeding instituted for that purpose.</p> <p>8. Interstate Rivers: Meander Lines: Navigable Rivers. As to those streams of water flowing through the state which may be classed as interstate rivers, and along the hanks of which meander lines have been run by the government in its survey of the public lands, the question is left open as to whether or not the waters of such streams may not be treated as waters of navigable rivers, to which riparian rights of an adjoining- landowner would not attach as against the right of the public to use the waters thereof by its approprial ion and application to beneficial purposes.</p> <p>9. Riparian Right: Naturae B\u2019jdow of Stream. While, as an abstract proposition of law, a riparian proprietor has the right to the ordinary natural flow .of a stream, this rule would furnish no basis for compensation where water is appropriated for irrigation purposes; in order to entitle a riparian owner to compensation he .must suffer an actual loss or injury to his riparian estate, which the law recognizes as belonging to him by reason of his right to the use and enjoyment of the water of which he is deprived.</p> <p>10. Riparian Proprietor: Use of WATER. Ordinarily, a riparian pro-prie.tor\u2019s right to the nse of water of a stream is limited to its use for domestic purposes, and, if applied to the irrigation of riparian lands, a reasonable nse for such purpose in view of an equal right to use belonging to all other riparian proprietors.</p> <p>11.-: Irrigation: Riparian Land. The right of a riparian proprietor as snch to nse water for irrigation purposes is limited to riparian lands.</p> <p>IS. Contiguous Land. The right can not be extended to lands contiguous to the riparian land, nor can water be. diverted to non-riparian lands which might be used on riparian lands, but is not.</p> <p>13. Definition of Riparian Land. Land, to be riparian, must have the stream Rowing over it or along its borders.</p> <p>14. Extent of Riparian Land: Area oe a Singue Estuv: <)i .eke. The extent of riparian land can not, in any event, exceed the area acquired by a single entry or purchase from the government; and whether, in view of the policy of the government in the disposition of its public lands, such riparian land may exceed the smallest legal subdivision of a section \u2014 that is, 40 acres \u2014 or in lien thereof, if an irregular tract, a designated numbered lot, which is bordered by a natural stream, or over which it flows, queere.</p> <p>15. Two Doctrines of Water Rights. The two doctrines of water / rights, one the right of a riparian proprietor, and the other the_right.of appropriation and application to a beneficial use by a non-riparian owner, may exist in the state at the same time, and both do exist concurrently in this state.</p> <p>16. Riparian Rights: Common-Law Rule: Precedence. The common-law rule of riparian rights is underlying and fundamental and takes precedence of appropriations of water if prior in time.</p> <p>17. Riparian Owner: Usufructuary Interest: Incident to Land. / The riparian owner acquires title to his usufructuary interest ( in the water when he secures the land to which it is an incident, and the appropriator acquires title by appropriation and the application of the water to some beneficial use; the time when either right attaches determining the superiority of title as between conflicting- claimants/</p> <p>18. Irrigation Acts: Abrogation ojp Private Riparian Eights. The The irrigation acts of 1889 and 1895 abrogated the law of private riparian rights as theretofore existing, and substituted in its stead a la,w providing- for the appropriation of the public ''waters of the state and their application to the beneficial uses therein contemplated.</p> <p>Effect of Legislation on Vested and Euture Eights. The legislative enactments referred to did not have the effect of abolishing vested rights of riparian proprietors, but affected only such rights as might have been acquired in the future under ihe law as theretofore existing.</p> <p>Judicial Notice: Irrigation: Vested Utgiitk: Question ott Fact. The court will take judicial notice of the fact that since the. early scitlenicnfs of the western portions of the state, where irrigation has been found essential to successful agriculture, a custom or practice has existed of appropriating and divei-ting- wafers from the natural channels thereof into irrigation canals, and ilie application of such waters to the. soil for agricultural purposes. Whether vested rights have been acquire thereby, must depend on the facts and circumstances as disclosed Jn any particular case. 20.</p> <p>31. Use of Water: Property Eight: Superior Tithe: Subseq'uent Eight. The right to the use of water, when acquired by appropriation, is in its nature a property right and becomes a superior and better title to the use and enjoyment of such water than that of a riparian proprietor whose right attaches subsequently.</p> <p>23. Act of Congress: Scope. The act of congress of July 26, 1860. granted to tlio.se appropriating waters on the public domain for / agricultural purposes a right in and to the use of such wafers' when made according to local customs, or when such right, is recognized by the laws .of the state or the decisions of the courts.</p> <p>23. Act of 1877: Scope: Acts op 1889 and 1895: Express Eecognition. The act of 1877 (Session Laws, 1877, p. 168) was an implied recognition of the right to appropriate the waters on the public domain according to the custom prevailing in the arid states immediately west of ns, and the irrigation acts of 1889 and 1893 expressly recognized and preserved the rights of those who had appropriated the public waters and applied them to agricultural uses.</p> <p>24. State Board of Irrigation: Duties: Administrative, Not Judicial: Constitutionality oe Law. The duties of the state board of irrigation as provided for in the irrigation act of 1895 (Session Laws, ch. 69), are administrative, and not judicial. The sections of the statute creating such hoard are not unconstitutional, as conferring judicial powers on executive officers.</p> <p>25. Riparian Rights: Laege Number oe Claimants: Appropriation: Duesoription: Injunction: Multiplicity oe Suits. Where a larg'e number of persons claim rights to use or divert the waters of a stream by virtue of riparian rights, appropriations, prescription .or otherwise, a suit in equity to determine such rights, and enjoin infringement, under color thereof, of rights acquired under the irrigation act, may he maintained to avoid multiplicity of suits.</p> <p>26.-:-: Owkr to Do ICquity: Compensation to Riparian Owner: Damage .Proper Subject oe Inquiry. The plaintiff in snch a suit may offer to do equity by compensating riparian owners whose rights are affected hy the construction and operation of a eanal without leaving them to their actions at law; and in that way the amounts due the several parties by way of damages may become a proper subject of inquiry and adjudication therein.</p> <p>27. \u201cDomestic Purposes\u201d: Statute: Riparian Proprietor: Common Law: Little Interference: Diversion: Larue Quantities: Canals: Pipe. Line. The term \u201cdomestic purposes\u201d, as used in section 43, article 2, chapter 93a, Compiled Statutes, 1901 (sec. 6797. Annotated Statutes), has reference to the use of water for domestic purposes permitted to the riparian proprietor at common law. which ordinarily involves hut little interference with the water of a stream or its flow,- and does not contemplate diversion of large quantities of water in canals or pipe lines.</p> <p>28. Common Law: Pipar\u00edan Owner: Right Defined. The common law does not give to.a riparian owner an absolute and exclusive right to the flow .of all the water of the stream in its natural state, but only a right to the benefit and advantage of the water flowing- past his land so far as consistent with a like right in all other riparian owners. -</p> <p>29. Superior Riparian Owner: Injunction: Diversion. A riparian owner having a superior title to the use of the water of a stream as against an appropriator is not entitled to maintain an. injunction to prevent the diversion of the storm or flood waters of the stream, and thereby prevent its application to a beneficial use, as contemplated by the statute.</p> <p>SO. Inferior Hipar\u00edan Owner: Receiving A-Vater: PsitswiiPTrys liimi\u2019t. There is no such tiling- as a prescriptive right o\u00ed a lower riparian owner to receive water as against upper owners. Receiving the full flow of a stream for more than ten years does not give a prescriptive right that will prevent reasonable use of its waters by an upper owner.</p>"}

and where the supply of percolating water which might be so removed is of slight value, and might he wholly interfered with by drainage on adjoining lands, a verdict fixing the value of the land at its market value for agricultural purposes will not be disturbed upon appeal.</p> <p>Id.\u2014Percolation not Inconsistent with Stream\u2014Defined Channei,.\u2014 The fact of percolation is not inconsistent with the idea of a stream, when it is caused by the waters of a subterranean stream passing through the voids of loose, permeable material filling or partially obstructing the channel of the stream, \u25a0 and. when the material through which the water forces itself fills a well-defined channel, with impervious sides and bed.</p> <p>Id.\u2014Diversion of Underflow or Percolating Water.\u2014The owners of the soil cannot divert any part of the underflow of subterranean water forming part of the stream, whether such water would or would not reach the surface stream of the river; nor can' he divert percolating water if the effect would be to cause the water of the stream to leave its bed to fill the void caused by such diversion.</p> <p>Id.\u2014Nature of Subterranean Stream \u2014 Question of Law\u2014Instructions\u2014Province of Jury.\u2014What a subterranean stream must be in order to bring it within the law of riparian rights, is a question of law; and instructions which are applicable to the evidence, and the entire scope of which includes nothing but a statement of the facts which the jury must find from the evidence, in order to determine whether there is a subterranean stream, and, if so, how much of the water in the land is part of the stream, do not usurp the province of its jury, or charge them upon questions of fact.</p> <p>Id.\u2014Rules of Subface Streams Applicable. \u2014 Subterranean streams flowing through known and definite channels are governed by the same rules that apply to surface streams.</p> <p>Id.\u2014\u201cDefined\u201d and \u201cKnown\u201d Channel\u2014Reasonable Inference.\u2014 The channel of a subterranean stream is \u201cdefined\u201d when it is contracted and bounded, though the course of the stream may be undefined to human knowledge; and its course is sufficiently \u201cknown\u201d when it is the subject of reasonable inference.</p> <p>Id.\u2014Inference as to Channel\u2014Submission to Jcry.\u2014Where the boundaries of the channel and the existence and course of a subterranean stream in the lands sought to he condemned are not defined or known, otherwise than by inference from the evidence, and it might reasonably be inferred therefrom that the channel was bounded and defined by the sloping sides of hills meeting \u2022 underground, and that there was a subsurface flow in that channel through such lands, corresponding with the known surface flow of the river outward through the gap, the court was justified in submitting to the jury whether the subsurface flow in such lands was a part of the stream.</p> <p>Id.\u2014Rights of City as Successor of Pueblo\u2014Instructions\u2014Ineffectiveness of Statute\u2014Province of Jury.\u2014The instructions given as to the rights of the city of Los Angeles as the successor of the pueblo, necessarily controlled the verdict of the jury as to those rights; and a request for a counter-instruction, submitting to the jury the ineffectiveness of an act of the legislature upon the rights of the defendants as claimants under Spanish and Mexican grants, is not matter within the province of the jury, and is properly refused.</p> <p>Id.\u2014Extent of Paramount Rights of City\u2014Riparian Rights of Mexican Grantees.\u2014The paramount rights of the city of Los Angeles in the waters of the Los Angeles river over the riparian rights of persons claiming under Spanish and Mexican grants are not \u25a0limited to water sufficient to supply the original pueblo, to which \u25a0 the city was a successor; but the extension of its limits by increase of the population must he deemed within the purview of the original grant of those waters to the pueblo, and the effect of the grant must be deemed the same as if the waters had been condemned for public use, and all possibilities of the future growth and requirements of the city were taken into eonsidera- \u2022 tion.</p> <p>Id.\u2014Outfall Sewer.\u2014The water having been granted or dedicated for \u2022 the health and convenience of the pueblo, as well as for other purposes, the right to drain the city by means of an outfall \u25a0 sewer, and to keep it in a state of' efficiency by the necessary flushing, is within the pueblo right.</p> <p>Id.\u2014Ponds and Artificial Lakes\u2014Discretion of City.\u2014The needs of the city may extend to the use of water for ponds and artificial lakes; and the discretion of the municipal authorities in such use will not he interfered with where no gross abuse of such discretion is manifest.</p> <p>Id.\u2014Suspension of Ayuntamiento.\u2014The suspension of the ayuntamiento of Los Angeles under the Mexican law of 1837, and the temporary administration of its affairs by a prefect, did not affect the paramount, rights of the pueblo to the use of the waters of the Los Angeles river.</p> <p>Id.\u2014Market Value of Property at Date of Summons\u2014Construction of Code\u2014\u201cActual Value\u201d\u2014Subsequent Discoveries.\u2014Under section 1249 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which makes the right to the property sought to be condemned accrue at the date of the summons, and provides that \u201cits actual value, at that date, shall be the measure of compensation,\u201d the market or exchange value of the property at the date of the summons is the only criterion of its \u201cactual value\u201d at that date, and \u201cactual value\u201d means actual market value. Subsequent discoveries as to the intrinsic value of the land cannot be considered for the purpose of showing that its actual value at the date of the summons was greater than its market value.</p> <p>Id.\u2014Authority for Proceeding\u2014Direction of City Council\u2014Subsequent Publication of Ordinance\u2014Ratification.\u2014Where the city council, by resolution, directed the city attorney to commence the proceeding for condemnation as soon as' the ordinance authorizing it was signed by the mayor, the subsequent publication of the ordinance as required is at least a ratification of the act of the officer in obeying the directions given, in anticipation of such publication.</p> <p>Id.\u2014Plan of Headworks\u2014Adoption of Engineer\u2019s Report\u2014Subsequent Adoption of Detailed Plan.\u2014It appearing that, prior to the commencement of the proceeding for condemnation, the city adopted an engineer\u2019s report recommending, in general outline and in all essentials, the plan for the headworks of its water system, for which the condemnation of lands was sought, the adoption, after its commencement, of a detailed plan, followed by other orders and resolutions providing the means for carrying it out, and complying with the terms of the judgment sought, cannot sustain the technical objection that the action was commenced without authority, in pursuance of a plan not formally adopted.</p> <p>Costs\u2014Transcript of Reporter\u2019s Notes \u2014 Agreement of Parties.\u2014 The taxation of the transcript of the notes of the official reporter as costs of the successful party is regulated by section 270 of the Code of Civil Procedure as it stood prior to the invalid amendment of 1885; and where the transcript was not ordered by the court, hut furnished to the parties at an agreed rate of compensation, it cannot he taxed as costs, and an item therefor is properly stricken from the hill of costs.</p>"}
