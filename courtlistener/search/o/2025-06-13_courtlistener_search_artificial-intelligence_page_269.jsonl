Reversed.Action by John M. Proctor against Southern Railway Co. on the following complaint:\n\n\"John M. Proctor, the plaintiff above named, by Graydon Giles, his attorneys, complaining of the Southern Railway Company, the defendant aforesaid, alleges:\n\n\"I. That the said defendant, the Southern Railway Company, is a corporation, duly chartered under and by virtue of the laws of the State of Virginia, and owns and operates a certain railroad between the cities of Greenville and Columbia, in this State, known as the Columbia and Greenville Railroad Company, together with the tracks, cars, locomotives, and other appurtenances thereunto belonging.\n\n\"II. That on the 13th day of September, 1899, while the plaintiff was returning from the city of Greenwood to his home in the county of Greenwood, in the State of South Carolina, and while traveling along the public road near the track of the defendant, driving two mules hitched to a two-horse wagon, at a point near the oil mill in the town of Ninety-Six, said county, the plaintiff observed an engine and a train of freight cars attached thereto, belonging to the defendant and operated by its agents, servants and employees,\non the track of the defendant, and moving in the direction of the said town of Ninety-Six and toward the plaintiff, and about to meet the plaintiff's wagon and team.\n\n\"III. That the plaintiff, to avoid meeting the said engine and train of freight cars attached thereto, drove out of and off of the said public road and away from the track of the defendant, and stopped his said team to allow the said engine and train of freight cars attached thereto, to pass, the said plaintiff being then and at all times in plain and open view of the defendant, its agents, servants and employees; when the defendant, its agents, servants and employees, saw that the plaintiff had moved his wagon and team off from the public road and away from the noise of said engine and train of freight cars attached thereto, then the defendant, its agents, servants and employees, caused the said engine and train of freight cars attached thereto, to come to a full stop on the track of the defendant's road.\n\n\"IV. That the plaintiff, seeing that the said engine and train of freight cars attached thereto had come to a full stop, then drove his said wagon and team back into the said public road and attempted to pass the said engine and train of freight cars attached thereto while standing, but as soon as the plaintiff approached near and opposite to the said engine, he being in the said public road, the defendant, its agents, servants and employees, who were in charge of the said engine and train of freight cars attached thereto and being in full and plain view of the plaintiff and his wagon and team, with intent to frighten and scare the plaintiff's team and injure the plaintiff, wilfully, wantonly and recklessly, and not regarding the rights of the plaintiff in that regard, let off steam from said engine, below the whistle attached to said engine, so that the said team of mules became frightened and unmanageable, and were made to run away, and threw the plaintiff out of said wagon and the wheels of said wagon were made to pass over the body of the plaintiff, inflicting serious and painful wounds and bruises on plaintiff's back, foot and injuring the plaintiff internally, so that he became\nill and sick, and for a long time was unable to attend to his business, and was confined to his bed and suffered intense pain from the injuries to his left kidney and he fears that from the effects of said injuries he will never be strong and well again.\n\n\"V. That by reason of the injuries as aforesaid, received by the wilful, wanton and negligent conduct of the defendant, its agents, servants and employees, the plaintiff has been damaged by the defendant in the sum of $1,995.\n\n\"Wherefore, the plaintiff demands judgment against the defendant in the sum of $1,995, and the cost of this action.\"\n\nThe trial Judge instructed the jury as follows:\n\n\"The case you have been trying and have now about reached the conclusion of is an action for damages brought by the plaintiff, Proctor, against the Southern Railway Company, for alleged injuries said to have been inflicted upon him by the railroad company or its servants. The allegations are of such a character as if established by testimony, by the preponderance of proof, would justify a jury in finding a verdict for damages, either actual damages or punitive, or both, or only actual or only punitive. It depends entirely on the testimony. The allegations are so framed that counsel had the right to introduce testimony as to actual damages and also evidence as to punitive, vindictive damages, and it is left entirely with the jury to say from the testimony whether the plaintiff has made out his case for damages of any kind or in any amount. You have heard counsel on both sides speak of actual and compensatory damages, and of punitive vindictive or exemplary damages, and perhaps a word or two of explanation may help you so that you may the better weigh the testimony.\n\n\"When a man seeks only actual damages, called also compensatory damages, he seeks at the hands of the jury only enough money to place him where he was before, to pay him back, to compensate him for the actual injury; but when he seeks and obtains punitive damages as well as actual, the\njury in the case, if it is a proper case, are allowed in law, after having ascertained how much he ought to receive as compensation, to add another amount of money, not for the purpose of the compensation of the plaintiff, but for the purpose of inflicting a penalty upon the defendant for the wrongdoing proved &#8212; something in the nature of a punishment, very similar to a fine imposed in a criminal court for a violation of the law, and intended not only to punish for the wrong-doing in the past, but to act as a warning for the future not to repeat such wrong-doing. Hence they are called punitive damages, the word `punitive' meaning of the character of punishment. They are also called vindictive damages, supposed to embody the righteous indignation of a jury at wanton, reckless, wilful wrong-doing, and they are also called exemplary damages, because they are supposed to operate as an example not only to the defendant who suffers the penalty, but to others in the same line of business who will take warning.\n\n\"Now, in this case, the plaintiff alleges that the injuries which he alleges in his complaint were inflicted upon him because of the wilful, wanton and reckless conduct of the railway company and its servants. These allegations, if they are sustained by sufficient proof, by the preponderance of the testimony, would justify a jury in finding punitive damages, and also actual, if proved. It is alleged here that the conduct spoken of as wilful, wanton and reckless, consisted in blowing the whistle of the engine and in letting off steam in a wilful, wanton and reckless manner, and, further, that those acts were done with the intent to frighten the plaintiff's team of mules, and also to injure him. So that, under the allegations of this complaint, the plaintiff charges not only that the conduct was wilful, wanton and reckless but with intent to frighten his mules and to injure him. He alleges, further, in his complaint that as a consequence of that conduct on the part of the railroad servants, he suffered injury, that his team ran off, having been frightened by the blowing of the whistle and the letting off of steam in the\nmanner described, and that he suffered painful wounds and bruises in his back, and he also suffered internal injury which caused him to be ill and sick and unable to attend to business for a long time, and that he was confined to his bed and suffered intense pain from injuries to his left kidney, so that he will never be well and strong again; and for these alleged injuries he claims damages to the extent of $1,995 &#8212; that otherwise odd sum being manifestly, of course, to come within the amount for which a suit of this character can be allowed in this Court and not removed to the Federal Court. If they had asked for more, for $2,000, probably the railroad company would have had a petition to remove it to the other Court; so that the amount alleged in the complaint may be explained in that way &#8212; $1,995 might have been $1,999.99, so far as that is concerned.\n\n\"The railway company, answering, denies that the plaintiff is entitled to any damages at all, denies all the allegations of the complaint; therefore, the burden of proof is put upon the plaintiff to establish his case according to the measure of proof, which is always applied in the Court of Common Pleas before a jury. In the Court of Common Pleas he is not required to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt, but by the preponderance of the testimony. So that you will take all the evidence that seems to favor, tends to favor or does favor, the plaintiff's claim on all these allegations, and put that evidence in one scale, and in the other scale over against it put all the evidence, no matter from what witness, that is against the plaintiff's claim, weigh the two batches of testimony, and if the testimony in favor of the plaintiff's claim clearly weighs more than the testimony against it, then the plaintiff's claim has been established by the preponderance of the testimony, which means the greater weight of the testimony, and I need not charge this intelligent jury that greater weight of the testimony cannot and should never mean the greater number of witnesses, because the testimony of one good, honest, truthful witness should in the opinion of an intelligent jury outweigh the testimony of a dozen or more\ndoubtful or untruthful witnesses; in other words, the question is: How much truth is there in the testimony? and if the jury finds more truth in the testimony of one man than in the testimony of twenty, then that man's testimony would outweigh the twenty who might be against him. You have heard all the testimony in the case. You are first to determine: how were the injuries inflicted? That is one of the main facts first to be ascertained. Did the plaintiff suffer any injuries? If so, what were they and to what extent has he been injured in his person? and are the injuries temporary, cured or curable, or permanent? If he has, according to the testimony, and that is your view of it, suffered injuries, then the next question is: Who is to blame? He charges that the railway company is to blame and should be made to pay him damages; in other words, he charges that the conduct of the railway company and its servants was the direct, proximate cause of the injuries he suffered. If that is your view of the case by the preponderance of the testimony, then if you are satisfied that the injuries were due directly to the wanton conduct of the railway company, or to the reckless conduct of the railway company, or to the negligence of the railway company, the plaintiff would be entitled to damages. If simply to the negligence, want of due care, of the railway company, he would be entitled to actual damages. If due to the wanton conduct, the wilful conduct, with intent to injure plaintiff, after some explanation on that point which I shall give you, he would be entitled to punitive damages.\n\n\"The plaintiff alleges that the blowing of the whistle and the letting off of steam was done recklessly. That means, done without care. Recklessly generally means gross negligence. It is a little stronger than carelessness in its usual application, but still an allegation of reckless conduct would justify a jury in finding that the conduct was ordinary negligence, want of due care, if the plaintiff failed to prove gross negligence, wanton, wilful misconduct &#8212; and what is meant by due care is simply that measure of caution and carefulness\nwhich was proper under the circumstances. That measure of care necessarily varies in the different cases, just because the circumstances developed in the different cases vary. A man who is driving a team of horses is expected by all people of intelligence and common sense to exercise due care, just that amount of care which he should exercise in proportion to the probable danger in driving a team of horses, and he is expected to exercise more care in driving that team of horses along the street of a town than out in the country. For obvious reasons the measure of care varies. So, also, the man who is driving or operating a locomotive and train, if there is more danger in working such machinery, from its weight and the speed with which it moves and the tremendous power which it takes, then common sense and intelligence would expect of him a greater degree of care, if there is greater danger in running a train than in driving a team of horses. So also, more care is expected of an engineer or conductor running a train along the streets of a town where there are numerous traveled places than out in the country where they have no reason to expect the presence of any person, may be, for miles or any other obstruction in the way. You see, therefore, that the measure of care necessarily varies, and under the varying circumstances just this amount of care is necessary: that amount of care which would or should have been exercised by a person of ordinary intelligence and prudence. A jury can easily apply that in every case. In this case, therefore, you are to say what amount of care should have been exercised by the railway company's servants in operating the train on the day mentioned in the complaint at the place mentioned in the complaint, under the circumstances detailed in the testimony under the allegations of the complaint. So much for due care.\n\n\"The plaintiff goes further and says that the conduct of the railway company's servants was wanton, wilful, showing an utter disregard of the rights of the plaintiff, and it was done with intent to frighten his team and to injure him.\nCounsel for the defendant has submitted to the Court as matter of law that a principal cannot be held liable in punitive damages for the wrongful acts of his agent or servant, and cited authority from the Supreme Court at Washington in other cases, and, as a general proposition, that is good law. The counsel for the railway company in this case submitted that as law, arguing that, as those cases argued, in the cases cited, a master should not be subjected to a penalty or a punishment for the wilful and wanton misconduct of his servant; he should be held liable in compensatory damages only, actual damages only. But like all general statements, they are not always applicable, not applicable to all cases. What is good law in one case would not be good law in another case, and the opinion of the highest court in the land, while good as to that particular case, might not be good as to another case where the facts would not correspond sufficiently with the facts of the case before the court; because whether or not a master or principal should be held liable in punitive as well as actual damages for the wrongful act of his servant, would depend on whether or not the acts of the servant or agent were committed while he was conducting the business of his master or principal within the scope of his agency, actually operating within the limit of his agency as such servant of the master, and whether the principal or master had either expressly or impliedly authorized or ratified or adopted the acts of the servant, or whether the master or principal had been guilty of negligence in selecting or employing his servant or agent. For example, if the railway company exercises due care in selecting and employing its servants to operate the train, and if those servants in operating the trains are guilty of personal acts of violence, for instance, upon a passenger, not in the line of the business as railroad servants but as individuals, why the railroad company would not be held responsible for such violent conduct on the part of the servants; but in conducting the business as servant they mistreated or maltreated a passenger, or are guilty of any wanton, wilful misconduct against\nany person, passengers or other people, or against property, if doing that in the line of the business, conducting the work of the master, then the general principle laid down would not apply &#8212; because the railroad company is held to act through its servants. That is all that the public sees of a railway company, the servants who operate the trains. They stand to the public as the railway company, and if in the conduct of the business as the railway company's servants or employees, they are guilty of wilful, wanton, reckless misconduct towards the public, showing an utter disregard for the lives and property or rights of the public, then the railway company, being a quasi public servant, is held responsible in punitive damages. So, also if the railway company could be shown in a proper case to have been reckless and careless in employing servants, placing incompetent, inexperienced and careless men in charge of dangerous machinery, like a locomotive, and if that incompetent, careless and reckless servant, who should not have been employed by the railway company, and who would not have been employed by the railway company if they had exercised proper care in selecting and employing a servant, is guilty of conduct which causes injury to the public because of his recklessness and incompetency, why then the railway company would in such a case be properly held liable in punitive damages, as well as in actual. As I have said, the railway company is a quasi public servant. It does not operate its railroad just as a private corporation operates its factory or its mills or any other business it may conduct. The railway company owes certain duties to the public. It does not run its road entirely for its own profit, but it is held bound to observe certain duties, and to discharge those duties to the public, and amongst them is that they should employ safe, competent servants who will run their trains with due care. So, also, it is very properly held that, while whistling, blowing the whistle and letting off steam, may be necessary, must be necessary, in operating a railroad, even if that, however, is done unnecessarily and wantonly and wilfully, for\nthe purpose of frightening horses or other cattle near the track, that is an infringement of the railway company's duties to the public, and if injury results therefrom, the railway is properly held liable in damages, either in actual or both actual and punitive, as the testimony in a proper case may justify. It is for you to say in this case whether the plaintiff has proved by the preponderance of the evidence that he was injured in the manner alleged. If he was, what was the extent of his injury? If he was injured to a certain extent, whether the injuries are permanent or temporary or both? If so, was the railway company to blame directly as the cause of that injury? If so, you will find out whether he is to obtain actual damages only or actual and punitive. With my explanation of the law, I think you will be able to say from the testimony whether he is entitled to either or both. If you come to the conclusion that he is entitled to damages, the amount is entirely in your power to assess, but it must be, of course, in accordance with the testimony. The amount claimed is $1,995. You cannot go beyond that, no matter what the damages proved, nor can you go to that extent unless you are satisfied that the proof justifies that as an amount, but any amount less than that. If you come to the conclusion that he is entitled to any damages, you will assess in accordance with the testimony. If he is entitled to actual damages, you will first fix that amount. Then also ask: Is he also entitled to punitive damages? Was the conduct of the railway company wanton, wilful, with intent to injure, frighten the team and injure the plaintiff? If you have not come to the conclusion, then you can only grant compensatory damages, actual not punitive. If you are satisfied that the injuries were inflicted by the railway company and were due simply to a want of due care, then you will simply award actual damages and not punitive damages. If you come to the conclusion that the plaintiff is entitled to a verdict for damages in any amount, you will write the verdict out in words, and not in figures, and say: We find for the plaintiff so many dollars damages. If the testimony\ndoes not satisfy you that the plaintiff is clearly entitled to his damages by the preponderance of the testimony, then you will say: We find for the defendant.\n\n\"I am very glad to be able to congratulate you and the counsel, that this case has been argued without any reference at all to wealthy corporations, or any attempt being made to stir up any prejudice in the minds of the jury against railway corporations, which always seem to me an insult to the intelligence of the jury, and altogether apart from the evidence in the case. You are left as honest men in this case by the counsel in this cause to judge of these parties, the railway on the one side and the plaintiff, Proctor, on the other, as if they were two individuals, or two letters of the alphabet, `A' against `B,' and you are to decide from the testimony whether the plaintiff has made out his case, and award the damages if he has. If he has not, then you will find for the railway company. You will take the record and write your verdict on the back of the summons and complaint.\"\n\nFrom judgment for plaintiff, defendant appeals.", "procedural_history": "", "scdb_id": "", "sibling_ids": [3878921], "source": "ZU", "status": "Published", "suitNature": "", "syllabus": "<p>1.
