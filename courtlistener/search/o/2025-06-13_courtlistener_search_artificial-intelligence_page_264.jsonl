Landis, Jr.,  for School District of St. Joseph of counsel.\n\n(1) A municipal corporation and a public service corporation cannot enter into a contract which will preclude the Public Service Commission from fixing reasonable rates, irrespective of the contract. State ex rel. City of Sedalia v. Pub. Serv. Commission,  275 Mo. 201 . (2) The method employed by the Commission in arriving at the valuation of the company's property for rate-making purposes was unlawful and arbitrary, whereas the method suggested by the appellant is one which has been approved by public service commissions and courts. Minneapolis v. Rand, 285 F. 818; Joplin Gas Co. v. Mo. Pub. Serv. Commission, P.U.R. 1924D, 137, 296 F. 271; Re United Rys. Co. of St. Louis, P.U.R. 1923d 759; Galveston Elec. Co. v. Galveston,  258 U.S. 388 , 272 F. 147; State ex rel. Water Co. v. Public Service Comm., 291 S.W. 788 ; Missouri ex rel. Bell Tel. Co. v. Public Service Comm., 233 S.W. 425,  262 U.S. 276 . (3) The construction overhead costs on land should be eliminated in arriving at a fair valuation of property for rate-making purposes. Minnesota Rates Cases, 230 U.S. 352 . (4) In arriving at the fair value of a plant for rate-making purposes account should be taken of accrued depreciation regardless of the efficiency of operation. Minneapolis v. Rand, 285 F. 818. (5) The Public Service Commission has uniformly adopted the straight line method of estimating accrued depreciation. Re Warrensburg Elec. Light, Heat Power Co., P.U.R. 1925B, 424. (6) No part of a depreciation reserve fund accumulated by a public service corporation from its receipts should be added to the capital upon which such corporation is entitled to earn dividends. Re Kansas City Gas Co., 14 Mo. P.S.C. 327; Railroad Commissioners v. Cumberland Tel. Tel. Co.,  212 U.S. 414 . (7) The depreciation\nreserve fund should be deducted from the valuation of the property to obtain a fair and reasonable valuation for rate-making purposes. Home Tel. Co. v. Carthage,  235 Mo. 644 ; Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. Pub. Serv. Commission, 233 S.W. 425,  262 U.S. 276 . (8) Interest on the depreciation reserve should be added to the reserve fund. Reed v. Tel. Co., P.U.R. 1920C, 390. (9) A fair and reasonable rate of return on the Company's property would, in view of present conditions, be seven per cent. Re Pekin Water Works Co. (Ill.). May 26, 1926; Re Greensburg Water Co. (Ind.), May 21, 1926; Re Mamaroneck v. N.Y. Inter. Water Co.,  212 N.Y.S. 639 ; Re Tuckerton Water Co. (N.J.), P.U.R. 1927A, 330; Re Chesapeake  Potomac Tel. Co. v. Commonwealth of Virginia, 136 S.E. 575, P.U.R. 1927B, 484; Re Customers v. Worcester Elec. Light Co. (Mass.), P.U.R. 1927C, 713, (10) The burden of establishing the reasonableness of a proposed increase in rates is upon the public service corporation. Re Joplin Water Works Co., 2 Mo. P.S.C. 235; Re Palmyra Tel. Co., 5 Mo. P.S.C. 328; Re Clarence Tel. Co., 9 Mo. P.S.C. 498. (11) The Commission's order in the former case No. 2520 was a mere general finding of the value of the property without a statement of the elements entering into the computation thereof, and would on appeal have been referred back for a more detailed finding of the facts. Minneapolis v. Rand, 285 F. 818; Lincoln Gas  Electric Light Co. v. Lincoln,  223 U.S. 349 . (12) A valuation of property of a public utility fixed by the Public Service Commission is not in the nature of an adjudication, and therefore is not conclusive for all time, and facts found by a Commission on a former valuation may be controverted without showing a change of conditions since such former valuation. State ex rel. Columbia Tel. Co. v. Atkinson,  271 Mo. 28 ; Marti v. Light Power Co.,  259 S.W. 793 . The question of valuation in the former case was a moot question, which would not have been reviewed on appeal. State ex rel. Columbia Tel. Co. v. Atkinson, 271 Mo. 28 , 195 S.W. 741.\n\n D.D. McDonald  for respondent;  W.R. Voorhis, C.H. Dickey  and R.A. Brown  for Intervener.\n\n(1) The legal proposition &#8212; that the return fixed on a utility property should be sufficiently high to attract capital to the enterprise &#8212; is one which is by no means novel. It was approved by the Supreme Court of the United States in the Bluefield Waterworks  Improvement Company case, and by numerous other courts of competent jurisdiction, as well as by writers of text on the subject. The public service commissions in nearly all of the states where commission regulation obtains have approved this rule as defining\none of the methods by which a fair rate of return may be properly gauged. 3 Spurr in Guiding Principles of Public Service Regulation, 56; Bluefield Waterworks  Improvement Co. v. Pub. Serv. Commission,  262 U.S. 679 , 67 L.Ed. 1176; Louisiana Water Co. v. Pub. Serv. Commission, 294 F. 954; Alton Water Co. v. Ill. Commerce Commission (D.C.), 279 F. 869; Toledo v. Toledo Rys.  Light Co., 259 F. 450, 170 C.C.A. 426; Indiana Bell Tel. Co. v. Pub. Serv. Commission, 300 F. 190; Kings County Lighting Co. v. Prendergast, 7 F.2d 194; New York  Richmond Gas Co. v. Prendergast (D.C.), 10 F.2d 186; Omaha  C.B. Street Railroad Co. v. State Railroad Com.,  103 Neb. 695 , 173 N.W. 691. (2) The respondents respectfully submit that this court should now affirm the judgment of the circuit court, affirming the report and order of the Commission, for the following reasons, to-wit; (a) Because the Public Service Commission in its report and order of August 11, 1925, authorized a schedule of rates which will produce for the respondent water company only a fair return on the fair value of its used and useful property. (b) Because in finding the fair value upon which the return was based, the Commission averaged the reproduction cost, less depreciation, and the investment cost of the property; and the value ascertained by this method was less than the reproduction cost less depreciation of the property. Having found a value which is less than that which would have been found had the rule laid down by the court in this case been followed, the City of St. Joseph and the water consuming public should not be heard to complain.", "caseName": "State Ex Rel.
