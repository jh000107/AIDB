{"absolute_url": "/opinion/3556372/kerens-v-st-louis-union-trust-co/", "attorney": "Boyle  Priest  and  Frank Y. Gladney  for appellant; Stanchfield  Levy  of counsel.\n\n(1) The court will resolve every doubt against the construction of the will contended for by the trust company and the remaindermen, for the trust company has completely identified its interest with the conflicting and partisan interest of the remaindermen, and is seeking a construction that will favor the remaindermen's interest, identified with its own. This is proved by the fact that the same counsel represent both the trust company and the remaindermen. Smith v. Jordan,  77 Conn. 473 ; Gordon v. Green,  113 Mass. 260 ; Bryant v. McIntosh, 3 Cal.App. 95 ; Marcom v. Wyatt,  117 N.C. 129 ; Arrington v. Arrington, 116 N.C. 170 ; Murray v. Lizotte,\nv. Johnston,  273 Ill. 458 ; Jones v. Jones,  223 Mo. 442 ; Taylor v. Mason, 9 Wheat, 351. (b) The clause charging the equitable estate with the payment of an obligation of the beneficiary guaranteed by the testator. King v. Ackerman,  67 U.S. 415 . (c) The conduct clause. Collier's Will,  40 Mo. 320 , 327; Simmons v. Cabanne, 177 Mo. 347 . (8) Wherever it is possible a will will be so construed as not to create a condition, particularly a condition precedent. Deacon v. Trust Co.  271 Mo. 687 ; Bryan v. Tylor,  129 Md. 150 . (9) The condition here is subsequent Burnham v. Burnham,  79 Wis. 557 ; Alexander v. Alexander,  156 Mo. 413 ; Simmons v. Cabanne, 177 Mo. 336 ; Jones v. Jones,  223 Mo. 445 ; Finlay v. King's Lessee, 3 Peters, 346; Taylor v. Mason, 9 Wheat. 350. (10) The conduct clause, if construed as an attempt to set up and fix a definite standard of conduct, is void and incapable of enforcement because it is so indefinite and uncertain that the court cannot know from the words of the will what was the true intent of the testator. Board of Trustees v. May,  201 Mo. 370 ; Reed v. Reed, 39 Mo. App. 477 ; Schmucker's Estate v. Reed,  61 Mo. 600 ; Hadley v. Forsee, 203 Mo. 428 ; Jones v. Jones,  223 Mo. 449 -50. (11) The power of the trust company to determine \"sobriety and good behavior\" and \"free will and desire\" must be found in the statute. State ex rel. v. Lincoln Trust Co.,  144 Mo. 562 ; Laws 1915, pp. 160-195. (12) The testator cannot enlarge or add to the statutory powers of the trust company. The meaning of the statute, whatever it may be determined to be, was fixed by the Legislature when the enactment was made. Harwood v. Tracy,  118 Mo. 631 ; Church v. McElhinney,  61 Mo. 543 . (13) In construing the statute the court will heed: (a) The general object and purpose of the Legislature. Ross v. Ry. Co.,  111 Mo. 26 ; Pembroke v. Huston,  180 Mo. 636 . (b) All the provisions of the statute, to get at the true meaning of any portion. Riddick v. Walsh,  15 Mo. 536 ; Macke v. Byrd, 131 Mo. 690 ; State ex rel. v. Harter,  188 Mo. 529 ; State ex rel. v. Ryan, 232 Mo. 92 . (c) That general words\nshall be accommodated to the intent, whether general or specific. State ex rel. v. Fry,  186 Mo. 203 ; Pennington v. Coxe, 2 Cranch, 52. (14) The statute imports at least three distinct characteristics of trust companies and one explicit definition of and limitation upon, the kinds of trusts that they can assume and execute, which, taken together, are decisive of the issue here involved. (a) The corporation is totally wanting in personality: Laws 1915, secs. 144, 141, 142, 157; Chicago T.  T. Co. v. Zinzer,  264 Ill. 31 . (b) Financial responsibility (in contrast with the personality of an individual) is made the sole ground or basis for such confidence or trust as the corporation is authorized to assume and execute. Laws 1915, secs. 121, 154-156. And financial accountability is the sole measure of its fidelity. Laws 1915, secs. 129, subd. 9, sec. 131. (c) The corporation is organized solely for pecuniary profit; it is a professional trustee for hire. The trust company differs fundamentally from a benevolent trustee organized under Art. 10, Chap. 33, R.S. 1909. Therefore, it is incapable by the law of its creation from assuming and executing a discretionary power that calls for an unmercenary, noneconomical and moral standard of decision, People v. Binghamton Trust Co.,  139 N.Y. 192 ; Constitution, art. 12, sec. 7; Reyburn v. Bakewell,  88 Mo. App. 647 . (d) The statute necessarily excludes a testamentary trust or confidence that (a) by the language of its creation, and (b) its intrinsic nature cannot be delegated to a substitute trustee without (a) violating a fundamental principle of equity jurisprudence and (b) defeating the expressed intent of the testator. Bodley v. Taylor, 5 Cranch, 225; State ex rel. v. Dearing,  180 Mo. 64 ; Arnett v. Williams, 226 Mo. 118 -9; Safe Deposit Co. v. Sutro,  75 Md. 365 ; Hazel v. Hagan,  47 Mo. 281 ; Bales v. Berry,  51 Mo. 451 ; Donaldson v. Allen,  182 Mo. 626 ; Security Co. v. Snow,  70 Conn. 288 ; Dillingham v. Martin,  61 N.J. Eq. 276 ; Whitaker v. McDowell, 82 Conn. 195 . (15) The intention of the testator, if inconsistent with the law, must give way. Brown v. Rogers,.\n\n Bryan, Williams  Cave  for respondent.\n\n(1) In the construction of ambiguous &#8212; or alleged ambiguous &#8212; expressions in a will, the situation of the parties may very properly and should be taken into view. And this is true even though the only question is as to the extent of the estate given a particular beneficiary. And oral testimony is admissible to show that situation. Smith v. Bell, 6 Peters, 68; Webb v. Hayden, 166 Mo. 46 ; Cornet v. Cornet,  248 Mo. 216 ; Robards v. Brown, 167 Mo. 457 . Few cases of will construction can be found in which the courts have not set out, and taken into view, the environment of the testator in attempting to gain his meaning. Schneider v. Kloepple, 193 S.W. 835. (2) The first and great rule in the exposition of wills, to which all other rules must bend, is that the intention of the testator expressed in his will shall prevail. Smith v. Bell, 6 Peters, 68; R.S. 1909, sec. 583; Graham v. More, 189 S.W. 1186. And this intent is to be gathered from the four corners of the will. McCaffery v. Monogue,  196 U.S. 569 . (3) \"An estate granted in one clause of the will may be cut down to a lesser estate by an express provision to that effect or by words so strong and clear as to have that effect by plain and necessary implication.\" Cox v. Jones,  229 Mo. 53 ; Schneider v. Kloepple, 193 S.W. 835; Gibson v. Gibson,  239 Mo. 491 . (4) The policy of the law in favor of the heir yields to the intention of the testator clearly expressed or manifested. McCaffery v. Monogue,  196 U.S. 569 . (5) This will, made under the existing conditions, read as a whole, clearly bespeaks the fact that the condition as to five years' sobriety by Vincent was intended by the testator as a condition precedent both as to possession and title: Graham v. More, 189 S.W. 1186; Jarboe v. Heye, 122 Mo. 341 ; McPike v. McPike, 181 S.W. 2; Partridges v. Cavender, 96 Mo. 352 ; Re Estate of Mary C. Jones, 48 L.R.A. (Mich.), 580;\nAbend v. McKendree College,  174 Ill. 96 ; French v. Northern Trust Co.,  197 Ill. 30 ; West v. Moore,  37 Miss. 114 ; Starck v. Conde, 100 Wis. 633 ; Hawke v. Euyart,  30 Neb. 149 ; Reuff v. Coleman, 30 W. Va. 171 ; Gunning's Estate,  234 Pa. 139 ; Bowman v. Long, 23 Ga. 242 ; Tattersall v. Howell, 2 Merv. 25; Perry on Trusts, par. 508; L.R.A. 1915 C, 1016, note. (6) The condition here leaving the question of sobriety, good behavior, free will and desire, etc., to the opinion, discretion or satisfaction of the named trustee, and authorizing the trustee to decide when the conditions had been performed, is neither indefinite nor uncertain. Jones v. Jones,  223 Mo. 450 . (7) Even were the condition so indefinite as to be unenforceable, it being a condition precedent, the plaintiff could take no estate whatever. But the condition is definite and certain. (8) The Trust Company has full power and capacity to act as trustee in a trust requiring the exercise of discretion. There are no known lines of demarcation between different kinds of discretion, and none can be drawn.
