(a) Where it appears from the evidence of a plaintiff himself that he is guilty of contributory negligence, it is the duty of the trial court to sustain a demurrer. Waldman v. Skrainka Const. Co.,  233 S.W. 242 ; Boyd v. Springfield, 62 Mo. App. 456 ; Holding v. St. Joseph,  92 Mo. App. 142 . (b) The plaintiff in the case at bar was guilty of such contributory negligence as to bar her recovery. It is the duty of a pedestrian to keep a lookout for openly apparent dangers on a public sidewalk. Wheat v. St. Louis.  179 Mo. 572 ; Butterfield v. Forrester, 11 East. 60; Sloan v. American Press, 37 S.W.2d 884 ; Hank v. St. Louis, 272 S.W. 933; Woodson v. Met. St. Ry. Co.,  224 Mo. 701 , 123 S.W. 820: Ryan v. Kansas City,  232 Mo. 471 , 134 S.W. 566; Hausman v.

St. Joseph,  168 Mo. 236 , 67 S.W. 588. Plaintiff's own testimony shows that she failed to look at the sidewalk; that she could have and would have seen and been able to avoid the danger had she looked. The evidence fails to disclose that defendant either had notice of the existence of the ice on which plaintiff slipped or that by the exercise of reasonable care it could have known of its existence and, absent such knowledge or opportunity for knowledge on defendant's part there can be no liability, Skelton v. Thompson, 3 Ont. 11; Stephens v. Deickman, 164 S.W. 931. (2) The court erred in admitting the evidence of witnesses Joseph and Brown and Myers as to the fact that snow gathered on the awning and melted and ran down on days during the trial and shortly before it the same being about a year after the accident. (a) Such evidence was only admissible as tending to show a like series of causation on the day of the accident. (b) To warrant its admission for this purpose it was necessary that plaintiff first prove that all conditions effecting such gathering of snow and its melting and the flowage of water caused thereby were identical on the day mentioned in the testimony and on the day of the accident. Lake Superior Loader Co. v. Huttig Lead  Zinc Co., 305 Mo. 130 ,  264 S.W. 396 ; 1 Wigmore on Evidence (2 Ed.), sec. 442; Emmerson v. Lowell Gaslight Co., 3 Allen, 410; Railroad Co. v. Champion,  32 Cal. 874 . (c) There was no such proof here. There was no proof of similarity of weather conditions. There was no proof that the condition of the building, including the cornice, awning, and awning mechanism, were the same, and the time concerning which\nthe evidence was given was so remote from the day of the accident (one year later) that no presumption to this effect can be indulged. Leidlein v. Meyer,  95 Mich. 589 , 55 N.W. 367. (d) This error could not be cured by the belated attempt to withdraw such evidence from the jury by instruction given at the close of the case. State v. Martin,  229 Mo. 640 ; State v. Mix,  15 Mo. 160 ; State v. Fredericks,  85 Mo. 150 ; Waldron v. Waldron, 156 U.S. 361 , 15 Sup. Ct. 383, 39 L.Ed. 459; Hopt v. Utah,  120 U.S. 403 , 30 L.Ed. 708; Throckmorton v. Holt,  180 U.S. 552 , 21 Sup. Ct. 474, 45 L.Ed. 671; Armour v. Kollmeyer, 161 F. 78, 16 L.R.A. (N.S.) 1110, 88 C.C.A. 247; Seafield v. Bohne,  169 Mo. 545 ; Haunan, Hickey Bro. Construction Co. v. Railroad Co., 247 S.W. 440. (3) The court should have ordered a removal of the cause when petitioned for by defendant at the close of plaintiff's case in chief. (a) Where a resident and nonresident defendant are joined the nonresident may nevertheless remove the cause where it appears that the controversy as to him was \"separable.\" U.S. Code, Title 28, Sec. 871; Yulee v. Vose,  99 U.S. 539 , 25 L.Ed. 355. (b) Removal on this ground may be sought at any time \"before the trial,\" and when the separable nature of the controversy does not appear until after the trial has been in progress removal may be sought at the time when this fact is first established. Youlee v. Vose, supra; Ford v. Roxana Petroleum Corp.,  31 F.2d 765 ; Fritzlen v. Boatman's Bank,  212 U.S. 364 , 29 Sup. Ct. 366, 53 L.Ed. 551; Powers v. Railroad Co.,  169 U.S. 92 , 19 Sup. Ct. 264, 42 L.Ed. 675. (c) Plaintiff's petition as originally drawn stated two causes of action &#8212; one for the negligent maintenance of the hood and cornice which was a cause existing as against the Newberry Company only and not as to Johnson, the other for the negligent failure to keep the walk clean which was a joint cause of action. Under the decisions of the Federal Supreme Court as long as the last cause of action remained in the case there was no separable controversy. Hay v. May Dept. Store Co., 271 U.S. 318 , 46 Sup. Ct. 498, 70 L.Ed. 965; Alabama Great Southern Railroad Co. v. Thompson,  200 U.S. 206 , 26 Sup. Ct. 161, 50 L.Ed. 441. (d) But when plaintiff failed to offer any evidence whatsoever as to the second ground of negligence the first only remaining in the case, the separability of the controversy first became apparent, giving a right to removal. (e) At the close of the evidence it first became apparent that Johnson had been joined without any possible evidence of his liability, and merely for the purpose of preventing removal. Such joinder is fraudulent in law and will not prevent a removal. Wilson v. Republic Iron Works,  257 U.S. 92 , 42 Sup. Ct. 35, 66 L.Ed. 144; Boatman's Bank v. Frizlen, 22 L.R.A. (N.S.) 1235; Wecker v. Natl. Enameling \nStamping Co.,  204 U.S. 176 , 27 Sup. Ct. 184, 51 L.Ed. 430; Treaster v. Railroad Co., 15 F.2d 542. The\nstatements of the petition are not conclusive on this question, but the whole of the evidence must be considered on the question of fraudulent joinder. Wilson v. Republic Iron Works, supra; Wecker v. Natl. Enameling  Stamping Co., supra; Treaster v. Railroad Co., supra; Morefield v. Ozark Pipe Line Corp., 27 F.2d 891. The fraudulent character of the joinder could not have become known to defendant until after the close of plaintiff's evidence, since at any time before plaintiff rested it was possible that she might have introduced some evidence in support of the allegations of her petition attempting to hold Johnson liable. Plaintiff's failure to offer any evidence as to the resident defendant was an abandonment of the action as to him and tantamount to a voluntary dismissal as to him. Sorrell v. Stone, 60 Tex. Civ. App. 51 ,  127 S.W. 300 ; Kansas, etc., Railroad Co. v. Hopkins,  18 Kan. 696 ; Bowman v. Purtell, 47 N.Y. Supp. Ct. 403. This made the cause removable at the close of plaintiff's case on the ground of diversity alone. Ford v. Roxana Petroleum Corp., supra. (4) The court erred in not striking out of plaintiff's petition on motion of defendant the allegations with reference to the premature birth and death of plaintiff's twin girls, since these allegations, and plaintiff's evidence predicated thereupon, sought a recovery, not alone for the excessive and unnatural pain, physical and mental of miscarriage, but also the death of the children. (a) Damages cannot be recovered for the loss of the children. 8 R.C.L. 470; Big Sandy Railroad Co. v. Blankenship, 133 Ky. 438 , 118 S.W. 316, 23 L.R.A. (N.S.) 345; Sullivan v. Railroad Co.,  197 Mass. 512 ,  83 N.E. 1091 ; Tennicliff v. Railroad Co.,  102 Mich. 624 , 61 N.W. 11, 32 L.R.A. 142; Morris v. Railroad Co.,  105 Minn. 276 , 117 N.W. 500, 17 L.R.A. (N.S.) 598; Prescott v. Robinson,  74 N.H. 460 ,  69 A. 522 , 124 Am. St. Rep. 987, 17 L.R.A. (N.S.) 594; Butler v. Railroad Co.,  143 N.Y. 417 , 38 N.E. 454 , 42 Am. St. Rep. 738, 26 L.R.A. 46; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Cooper,  71 Tex. 507 , 9 S.W. 598, 10 Am. St. Rep. 772, 1 L.R.A. 728; Hawkins v. Ry. Co.,  3 Wn. 592 , 28 P. 1021, 28 Am. St. Rep. 72, 16 L.R.A. 808. (b) Nor can damages be recovered for the mental suffering of the wife occasioned by grief for the loss of the children. L.R.A. 1917E, 1050. (c) But in the portions of the petitions stricken at by defendant's motion, and in the portions of the evidence introduced thereunder, these improper elements of damage are so inextricably confused with the proper elements of excessive pain caused by the premature birth as such, that the jury must have been confused thereby. (5) The verdict of the jury was for $10 and not as the court construed it for $10,000; hence the judgment entered for $10,000 did not correspond to and was not based upon the verdict and was unfounded and improper. (a) The dollar is a well established unit of money, and the decimal system based thereon\nis established by law. Therefore the fact that the jury wrote $10,000 must be read as 10 monetary units and no decimal portions of such units. Bouvier's Law Dictionary, 1 U.S. Stat. at Large 246. (b) Where a number is written as a decimal the addition of ciphers after the decimal point does not change the value of the number at all regardless of the number of ciphers so added. (c) Although in the earlier decisions this court refused to take judicial notice of the dollar mark (a ruling which if followed would make this verdict absolutely void) it no doubt will not follow the more liberal view of the Illinois court to the effect that this abbreviation is a well recognized part of the English language. But if it does so it must also judicially notice the fact that ciphers added after a sum of dollars to express the absence of fractional parts of dollars are made smaller than those in the number expressing dollars. (d) The verdict is a clear one for $10, and hence the affidavits of the jurors introduced are for the purpose of \"impeaching\" it, and not for the purpose of construing a verdict containing a patent ambiguity. For this reason they are inadmissible. (6) The verdict was grossly excessive and obviously the product of passion and prejudice on the part of the jury. Plambeck v. Railroad Co., 214 Ill. App. 636 ; Knox v. M., K.  T., 203 S.W. 225, 119 Mo. App. 64 ; Powers v. Nathan Straus Co., 157 A. 131. (7) The liability of Newberry was a liability for the negligence of its servant Johnson only, for (a) Johnson as general manager had undertaken to look after the building and hence would be liable to third persons for both negligent acts and negligent omissions committed in looking after it. 18 R.C.L., sec. 270, 25 L.R.A. (N.S.) 343; Orcutt v. Century Bldg. Co.,  201 Mo. 424 ; Carson v. Quinn, 127 Mo. App. 525 ; Bannigan v. Woodbury, 122 N.W. 531; Stiewel v. Borman,  63 Ark. 30 , 20 A.L.R. 97. (b) The Newberry Co., as a corporation, could not commit a tort except thru the acts of some agent. 14a C.J. 768. (8) Where the servant is not held liable, the master also must be exonerated from liability. McGinnis v. Railroad Co.,  200 Mo. 347 ; Whiteaker v. Railroad Co., 252 Mo. 438 ; Michely v. Mississippi, etc., Co.,  221 Mo. App. 205 ; 14a C.J. 768; 31 A.L.R. 188.\n\n Rendlen, White  Rendlen  for Stith.\n\n(1) The demurrer as to defendant Newberry Company was properly overruled. (a) Under the evidence in this case, defendants' negligence was the sole cause of the injury and no contributory negligence on the part of plaintiff being shown, the court very properly overruled the demurrer and submitted the case to the jury. At most the alleged contributory negligence was for the jury. Gray v. Hannibal, 29 S.W.2d 713; State v. Trimble, 9 S.W.2d 876 ;\nHeberling v. Warrensburg,  204 Mo. 617 ; Alexander v. St. Joseph, 170 Mo. App. 378 ; Hebenheimer v. St. Louis,  296 Mo. 92 , 189 S.W. 1182; Smith v. Kansas City, 184 S.W. 82; Scanlan v. Kansas City, 19 S.W.2d 522 ; Hilliard v. Noe, 198 S.W. 435. (b) Defendants were shown to have had sufficient notice, under all the circumstances, of the matters complained of. Campbell v. Chillicothe,  239 Mo. 462 ; Peterson v. Kansas City, 23 S.W.2d 1048. (c) Specific notice of a particular condition is not necessary where, as in this case, the cause is continuing, and arises from a permanent condition. Defendant is charged with notice. Studer v. St. Joseph, 185 S.W. 1196; Benton v. St. Louis, 248 Mo. 98 ; Campbell v. Chillicothe,  239 Mo. 461 . (d) No contributory negligence being shown by the evidence, the demurrer was properly overruled, for the further reason that there is no denial in the answer of the negligence pleaded in the petition and it therefore stands admitted. Secs. 776, 800, R.S. 1929; Dezell v. Fidelity  Casualty Co.,  176 Mo. 253 . (2) There was no error in admitting the evidence of witnesses Joseph Brown, and Myers. (a) There was positive and uncontradicted evidence of exact similarity of all conditions, making the evidence competent. Lake Superior Loader Co. v. Hutting Lead  Zinc Co., 305 Mo. 130 ,  264 S.W. 396 . (b) Any alleged error was wholly cured by withdrawing the evidence from the consideration of the jury and in instructing both orally and in writing that the jury disregard it. Snyder v. Car  Foundry Co.,  14 S.W.2d 603 ; Consolidated School Dist. v. Power Co., 46 S.W.2d 179; Harrison v. K.C. Elec. Co.,  195 Mo. 635 . (c) Defendants are not entitled to allege error as to this because they elicited the same evidence on cross-examination, allowed the same at other times without objection, introduced independent evidence themselves of a similar nature and never at any time asked that the jury be discharged. They asked that the evidence be excluded and the jury instructed to disregard it, all of which was done. They asked for no more. Their objection here comes late, and was waived. Snyder v. Car  Foundry Co., supra; Siberell v. Railroad Co.,  9 S.W.2d 912 . (d) Furthermore, the verdict is amply supported by much other competent and unquestioned evidence, so that the error, if any, is harmless and in no event affects the merits of the action. Richardson v. Marceline,  73 Mo. App. 364 ; O'Neill v. Kansas City,  178 Mo. 102 ; McMillan v. Ry. Co., 70 Mo. App. 572 . (3) The court properly denied the petition for removal to the United States Court, the resident defendant being in the case until the close of the entire case, when the instruction in the nature of a demurrer was given, plaintiff taking an involuntary nonsuit with leave to move to set the same aside and being now in the case upon plaintiff's due appeal to this court as to the trial court's action in overruling plaintiff's motion to set the same aside, and abundant evidence being offered as to his\nindividual negligence as manager of the non-resident defendant company. Craig v. K.C. Terminal Ry. Co.,  271 Mo. 516 , 197 S.W. 142. (4) There was no error in the court's refusal to strike out of plaintiff's petition the allegation concerning the premature birth or miscarriage, and the immediate death of the babies, there being no other way of pleading the facts with respect thereto. The petition must set out the plain and concise facts, and not conclusions, as to the cause of action relied upon, and failing to do so is bad pleading. Sec. 764, R.S. 1929; Koewing v. Green County B.  L. Assn.,  38 S.W.2d 40 . (a) Defendants are estopped here, to allege error in the introduction of evidence thereon, there being no other way to prove the necessary allegation, and because defendants objected to no such evidence during the trial, nor moved to strike it out, or for mistrial, and brought out the same evidence both on cross-examination and from their own witnesses. Conduit v. Trenton G.  E. Co., 31 S.W.2d 27; Peugh v. Peugh,  233 S.W. 31 ; State ex rel. St. Louis B. T. Ry. Co. v. Haid,  29 S.W.2d 714 . (b) The burden is on appellants to show wherein they were prejudiced by the court's overruling their motion to strike. Absent such showing, there is no error. Span v. Jackson, Walker C.  M. Co., 16 S.W.2d 202. (c) Appellant, not offering any instruction on the measure of damages, cannot complain of the one given for plaintiff. Keyes v. Ry. Co., 31 S.W.2d 64; Longan v. Weltmer,  180 Mo. 336 . (d) The motion to strike out part of plaintiff's petition is not only devoid of merit, but when the same was overruled, defendants filed answer, and hence waived the right to contest the ruling of the court on said matter. Reynolds v. Davis, 260 S.W. 996, 303 Mo. 418 ; Titus v. Development Co.,  264 Mo. 240 ; Liese v. Meyer, 143 Mo. 556 . (5) There was no error in entering judgment for $10,000, the verdict being clearly for that amount, the court having polled the jury, asking them at the time if $10,000 was their verdict, to which they responded affirmatively. The court understood and accepted the verdict as for $10,000, and the judgment recites in accordance with verdict of the jury plaintiff recover ten thousand dollars as her debt and damages. The affidavit, which was filed, pending motion for new trial, of the entire jury confirming the amount was competent to explain it as a verdict for $10,000. Hays v. Hogan,  273 Mo. 1 , 200 S.W. 286; Brickell v. Fleming, 281 S.W. 957. (6) The verdict is in no manner excessive, but on the contrary a very modest one, fully concurred in by the entire jury panel, approved by the trial judge, and there being nothing in the case nor anything shown by defendants calling for appellate interference, this court will not disturb it. Manley v. Wells, 292 S.W. 67; Burton v. Brennan Gro. Co., 13 S.W.2d 567; Maloney v. United Rys. Co., 237 S.W. 509; Jackson v. Ry. Co., 231 S.W. 978; State ex rel. Biando v.

Subrogation \u2014 Holders of Invalid Bonds.</p> <p>Where a county undertakes to fund its outstanding indebtedness into bonds, and on issuing such bonds, payable to bearer, takes up, cancels, and destroys the warrants evidencing such indebtedness, and the bonds are bought in the open market, and are afterwards repudiated by the county, and are held by the court to be void, for want of power at the time in the county to issue them, the purchaser of the bonds for a valuable consideration, on offering to .surrender them to the county, is entitled to be subrogated to the rights of the original warrant holders, and to recover from the county the amount of the warrants. Irvine v. Commissioners (C. C.) 75 Fed. 765, followed.</p> <p>2. Statute of Limitations \u2014 Invalid Bonds \u2014 Action on Original Consider- ' atton.</p> <p>The statute of limitations does not begin to run against such suit until denial by the county of its obligation on such bonds; and the action of the county commissioners of such county in adopting a resolution recognizing the obligation of the county on the warrants, and directing the funding of the debt into bonds, is tantamount to a new acknowledgment, and stopped the running of the statute of limitations.</p> <p>8. Action on County Bonds \u2014 Burden of Proof.</p> <p>Where the defendant county undertakes to defeat recovery on such warrants on the ground that they were fraudulently issued or were a nudum pactum, the burden of proof rests upon the county to establish such facts. It is not sufficient to defeat a recovery that the evidence should show, in a general way, that the county commissioners were recklessly extravagant, or that they issued warrants for questionable purposes, or even in greater amounts than were honestly owing by the county; but the proof must go further, and identify the particular warrants in suit with such illegal transactions.</p> <p>4. Same \u2014 Evidence.</p> <p>Where the defendant county offers In evidence its county record for the purpose of identifying the warrants in suit, with the numbers entered in such record, and it appears on the face thereof that there, have been erasures and substitutions of certain numbers, and additions of other numbers on the outside of the marginal lines of the record, to make out the correspondence of such numbers with those of the warrants in suit, and such tampering with the record is unexplained by the official custodian of such record, and other entries in such record, to eke out the essential identity, are carried forward, out of consecutive order, many hundred pages, to the latter part of the record, not signed by the proper officers of the county as by statute required, such part of the record should be excluded.</p> <p>5. Same \u2014 County Warrants.</p> <p>What purports to be a \u201cstub book\u201d of the county, introduced by the defendant for the purpose of identifying by the stubs some of the warrants in suit (such book not being required by the statute to be kept by the county, and it appearing that such book had for a considerable time been in the possession of a person other than the \"official custodian of the county records and flies, and by him carried about over the country, and not identified by the proper officer of the county as of the records or files of his ofiice), is incompetent evidence on behalf of the county.</p> <p>6. Same \u2014 Defenses.</p> <p>The defense to such warrants that they had been issued in excess of the statutory limitations of the amount of debts for current expenses of the county for the given year, based upon the assessed valuation of the taxable property of the county, is not maintainable as a complete defense to all the warrants in suit, in the face of the agreed statement of facts that in the county, newly organized, there had been no assessment of the property for purposes of taxation anterior to the issue of the warrants. Hel\u00e9, further, that inasmuch as the law contemplates that in the administration of a territory, like a township, preliminary to its organization into a county, special, extraordinary expenses, distinguished from \u201ccurrent expenses\u201d in the conduct of an organized county, are legally permissible, it devolves upon the defendant county to show affirmatively what particular warrant in suit, was issued on account of such current expenses, and what particular warrant is in excess of the statutory limitation.</p> <p>7. Evidence- -Official Certificates.</p> <p>A certificate made by a person designated as an \u201cenumerator\u201d appointed by the governor of the state to report to him the minimum number of inhabitants and the taxable property in the county, for the information of the governor preparatory to the issue of a proclamation by him designating the given territory as an organized county, is inadmissible in evidence to show the assessed valuation of the taxable property of the county in this suit.</p> <p>8. Same.</p> <p>Equally incompetent for such purpose is a compilation of the taxable property of the county found in the published reports of the state auditor; likewise a certificate of the clerk of the county, found in the state auditor\u2019s office, giving the valuation of property in the county,' claimed to have been furnished when said bonds of the county were presented to the state auditor for registration; there being no statute of the state then in force authorizing such registration or certificate, and no evidence that the original warrant holders or bondholders, or purchasers of the bonds, presented such certificate to the state auditor, or had any knowledge thereof. There can be no presumption that such certificate was presented by either of such persons, in the absence of a statute requiring its presentation.</p> <p>(Syllabus by the Court.)</p>"}
