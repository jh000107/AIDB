A legislative act is presumed in law to be within the constitutional power of the body making it, whether that body be a municipal or a state legislative body.</p> <p>2. That presumption of validity of such legislative enactment cannot be overcome unless it appear that there is a clear conflict between the legislation in question and some particular provision or provisions of the constitution.</p> <p>3. Legislation, in order to be definite and certain, must either expressly, or by clear implication, classify the persons, .things, conditions and the like, upon which the law shall operate.</p> <p>4. Classification is an inherent right and power in legislation, limited only by the constitution and the judicial constructions thereunder.</p> <p>5. A classification must not be arbitrary, artificial, or evasive, but there must be a real and substantial distinction in the nature of the class or classes upon which the law operates.</p> <p>6. In respect to such distinctions, the legislative body has a wide discretion, and the legislation involving classification will not therefore be held invalid unless the classification attempted is clearly and obviously unreasonable to the point of discriminating against members of the same class, so as to deny them the equal protection of the laws.</p> <p>7. A classification of street obstructions into temporary and permanent, and providing that the ordinance shall operate only upon temporary obstructions, is a real and reasonable classification, and does not violate any provision of state or federal constitution.</p> <p>8. The guarantee of \u201cequal protection of the laws\u201d under our constitutions is fully complied with when the law operates equally upon each member of a constitutional class.</p> <p>9. A legislative body may direct its legislation against any evil as it actually exists, without covering the whole field of possible abuses, and it may do so none the less that the forbidden act does not differ in kind from those that are not forbidden.

There is no inhibition upon parties calling as many witnesses as they may desire; but every party must assume the risk of having taxed against him the fees of all such witnesses as the court may find were unnecessary, being not less than two. A motion to restrict a party to a certain number of witnesses whose fees may be taxed as costs, is addressed to the discretion of the trial court, and its decision is not subject to review, except where the discretion is abused.</p> <p>4.

Where a part is taken, and that part has a greater value, in connection with the whole, than as a separate parcel, the measure of damages will be the fair cash value of the part taken, as a part of the whole.</p> <p>6. Same\u2014measure of damages\u2014as to part not taken. Where a cross-petition is filed for damages to land not sought to be taken, but a part of that sought to be condemned, the jury should award to the owner such damages, in cash, as his lands not taken will sustain, if any, by reason of the construction of the proposed railroad, and its continued use and operation, through his farm. In such case it is proper for the jury to give damages for all actual and appreciable injuries resulting from the construction and operation of the proposed railroad.</p> <p>7. If the lands not taken will be depreciate-1 in value by the construction and operation of the proposed railroad, the measure of damages will be the difference in their market value before the construction of the road- and after its construction. In determining this, the jury may consider the injury to the land arising from inconveniences actually brought about by the construction of the proposed railroad, or incidentally produced by dividing the land as to water, pastures and improvements, although such injiu-y may not be susceptible of definite ascertainment, and also for such incidental injury as would result from the perpetual use of the track for moving trains, or from danger of killing stock, or injury to pasturing stock, or escape of fire, and generally for such damages as are reasonably pi obable to. ensue from the construction and operation of the proposed road.</p> <p>8. The physical condition of land over which a right of way is sought to be condemned for a railroad, whether affected by another railroad, a watercourse, or other natural or artificial object, must be considered in the proceeding,\u2014not in respect to the damage or depreciation caused by such other railroad, water-course, etc., but for the purpose of determining the damages \u25a0occasioned to the owner by the proposed improvement.</p> <p>9.

An instruction that the land owner is entitled to just compensation for the land taken, and for all \u201creasonable and probable damage\u201d to the balance of his land not taken, caused by taking the strip condemned for the uses and purposes of the proposed railroad, is not obnoxious to the objection that it opens the door to let in remote, conjectural and speculative damages.</p> <p>11.
