POPE, J. (after making the foregoing statement of the facts). \u2014 The assignments -of error are quite numerous-but may be classified generally as embodying seven contentions: That the court erred (1) in overruling defendant\u2019s demurrer to the complaint; (2) in refusing to sustain defendant\u2019s motion in arrest of judgment; (3) in-overruling defendant\u2019s motio", "type": "lead-opinion"}], "panel_ids": [], "panel_names": [], "posture": "", "procedural_history": "", "scdb_id": "", "sibling_ids": [6467464], "source": "U", "status": "Published", "suitNature": "", "syllabus": "<p>SYLLABUS (by THE COURT).</p> <p>1. In adverse suits brought pursuant to R. S. U. S. 2326, an ordinary declaration in ejectment is sufficient to present all the questions involved between the applicant for patent and an adverse claimant; following Deeney v. Mineral Creek Milling Co., 11 N. M. 279.</p> <p>2. In such suits, however, the rules -governing ordinary ejectment suits are -modified by -C. L. 2290 which provides that mere prior possession shall not constitute a basis for recovery and by the Act of Congress of \u00a1March 3, 1881, which requires that the defendant no less than the plaintiff shall recover on the strength of his own title.</p> <p>3. In order therefore that the court may be advised of the nature of the suit so as to apply these exceptional rules, there should in .addition to the ordinary allegations in ejectment be appropriate allegations showing the- fact that such suit is designed as an adverse suit.</p> <p>4. The complaint in the present cause examined and held sufficient for adverse suits.</p> <p>5. -In such a suit a verdict in the form \u201cWe the jury find the defendant guilty\u201d i\u00ae sufficient to answer \u00a1all the purposes of the proceeding.</p> <p>6. In suich a -suit the parties are upon proper request entitled to special findings upon questions relevant to the cause but in the absence of such request it is not error for the Court to fail to require findings of the jury.</p> <p>7. In descriptions natural or artificial monuments ordinarily prevail over courses and distances.</p> <p>8. A call in a description for \u201cWest\u201d will be read \u201cEast\u201d, where such \u00a1change is necessary to enable -the survey to close upon the starting corner.</p> <p>9. In case \u00f3f a conflict in the calls of a description such elements of description will be preferred as are the least liable to mistake.</p> <p>10. If the rejection of a call will reconcile all parts of the description and leave enough to identify the tract, such call will ibe rejected and the description thus preserved.</p> <p>11. Where therefor a \u00a1single call of description fixes the tract by course and distance from a common section corner as in Range Fourteen, when several other, descriptive calls fix it by reference to known monuments and mining claims as in Range Twelve, the discordant element, of description first named will be ignored and the description read as in Range Twelve.</p> <p>12. Section 2332 R. S. U. S. providing .that when parties, have held and worked mining claims for the period prescribed by the local statute of limitations, such possession shall be sufficient to establish a right to patent in the absence of any adverse claim is to be construed in connection with the remaining federal mining statutes.</p> <p>13. When so construed, its effect is simply to declare that possession tor the statutory period is the equivalent of ai valid location.</p> <p>14. Possession for the statutory period under R. S. Section! 2332 does not relieve the possessor from doing the annual assessment work required by R. iS. iSection 2324, and upon his failure to do such work in any one year, the land becomes subject to relocation notwithstanding he may have occupied it for more than the statutory period preceding such relocation.</p> <p>15. Possession and working for the statutory period under R. S. 'Section 2332 when proved in the land office or before the Courts give the possessor the status of a valid locator, but testimony to prove such possession is immaterial where the party offering such testimony claims under a location duly made pursuant to law and there is no issue as to the original validity of such location, but simiply as to whether he had forfeited it by failure to do the annual assessment for a given year.</p> <p>16. Improvements placed upon one of a group of contiguous claims for the purpose of aiding in the development of all and tending to such result may be considered in determining whether the annual labor for a given year has \u2022been done upon any one of such group.</p> <p>17. Before, however, such .testimony can be considered in aid of any one claim there must be sufficient testimony as to the other claims to enable the jury to determine what proportion of such benefit is referable to the claim in question.</p> <p>18. Tested by these rules, the court belo.w did not err in charging the jury to disregard as an elem\u00e9nx In determining whether the annual work had been done the existence of a blacksmith shop and blacksmith impleipents found upon the claim in question placed .there for the benefit of this and other claims.</p> <p>19. C. L. Section 2286 which requires the locator of a mining claim to post a location notice \u201cin some conspicuous .place on such location\u2019\u2019 is supplemental to and not inconsistent with the federal mining laws and is consequently valid; and a failure to comply substantially therewith renders- -the location void.</p> <p>20. The mere fact however that the -portion of the claim upon which such notice is posted -may by mistake overlap or conflict with a preexisting claim does not invalidate the location. Such location is -still good as to so much not in conflict.</p> <p>21. A forfeiture of a mining claim for failure to do annual work can be established only upon clear and convincing proof of such default proved against the former owner by the party assailing his title.</p> <p>22. Where, however, the owner has failed to make and fila the proof of -labor required by C. L. Section 2315, such owner is not entitled to invoke the rule of law last stated since Section 2315 .places the burden of proof upon him to show that such work has been done according do law, and not upon his opponent to show that it has not been done.</p>"}

Statutes\u2014title oe an act\u2014constitutional requirement\u2014prior to the existing rule. Before the present constitutional provision on the subject, the title to an act was no part of it, and although it might be looked to as a guide to the intention of the law-makers, where the body of the statute appeared ambiguous or doubtful, yet it could not enlarge or restrict the provisions of the act itself, and the latter might be good even when in conflict with the title, and there might be incorporated into the same act as many different subjects as the legislature saw fit.</p> <p>2. Same\u2014restrictions of present constitution \u2014 of their application, generally. The provisions of section 13, article 4, of the constitution of 1870, should be so construed as to put an end to the former vicious legislation intended to be prevented, but it is not the design of those provisions to embarrass legislation by making laws unnecessarily restrictive in their scope and operation. The general purpose is accomplished when a law has but one general object, which is fairly indicated by its title.</p> <p>3. The generality of a title is not objectionable, so long as it is not made to cover legislation incongruous in itself, and which by no fair intendment can be considered as having a necessary or proper connection. The legislature must determine for itself how broad and comprehensive shall be the object of a statute, and how much particularity shall be employed in the title defining it. It is purely a matter of legislative discretion whether the subject expressed shall be general or specific.</p> <p>4. Same\u2014act embracing more than one subject\u2014and all expressed in the title. Where an act embraces two subjects, both of which are expressed in the title, the entire act must be held void. In that case, a proviso that if any subject is embraced in the act which is not expressed in the title, the act shall be void only as to so much as is not so expressed, can not be given effect. The court can not elect between them, so as to preserve the one and reject the other.</p> <p>5. Same\u2014whether more than one subject is expressed\u2014as, in the \u201csanitary\u201d act of 18S9. A subject may be composed of many parts, and it does not follow that because the title of an act enumerates many particulars there are therefore many subjects. If there is but one subject, the act is valid, although the subject may be composed of many parts, and all of them are enumerated in the title.</p> <p>6. So in the act of 1889, entitled \"An act to create sanitary districts; and to remove obstructions in.the Des Plaines and Illinois rivers,\u201d the general subject expressed is the creation of sanitary districts, and the removal of obstructions in the rivers named is so far germane to that subject as to constitute a part of it. There is therefore but one subject expressed in the title.</p> <p>7. Same\u2014act embracing subjects not in title. If an act of the legislature embraces several subjects, of which but one is expressed in the title, the subjects not expressed may be rejected, and the act, so far as it relates to the subject expressed in the title, may be held to be valid.</p> <p>8. Same\u2014measures promotive of the purposes of the act\u2014as germane to the general subject\u2014and herein, of an act to create a sanitary district. A sanitary district is a municipal corporation organized to secure, preserve and promote the public health. Any subsidiary measure having a greater or less tendency to promote that object, or to advance the general scheme by which it is proposed, through the agency of such organization, to preserve and protect the public health, is germane to the general subject of the act.</p> <p>9. If the general scheme adopted is one which, upon any rational theory, is calculated to promote the object for which the corporation is created, and if the subsidiary provisions of the act are calculated, upon any rational theory, to promote and further the general scheme, the provisions of the act can not be foreign to the general subject expressed in the title.</p> <p>10. All corporations in this country are the creatures of the legislative power, and it necessarily follows that the determination as to what shall be their constitution, objects and powers, is a matter wholly within the legislative discretion. Any measures authorized which are calculated to promote the object of the corporation, may be said to be embraced in the title.</p> <p>11. In the creation of municipal corporations of a certain character, as, for sanitary purposes, the subject expressed in the title of the act includes the investing of the corporation created with all necessary and proper powers, functions and duties, and provisions directing the mode in which those powers, functions and duties shall be exercised and performed, and prescribing the rules of public policy which shall obtain and be observed in their performance, are clearly germane to the same subject.</p> <p>12. Where a sanitary district is formed to construct a system of drainage, which in its results will necessarily affect certain rivers and canal-ways by largely increasing the volume of water therein, provisions of the act creating the district, which impose duties upon the district to take proper steps to prevent injury to others by such increased flow of water, are a'necessary part of the general system of drainage for sanitary purposes, and within the object expressed in the title of the act.</p> <p>13. A law for the formation of a sanitary district for the drainage of a large territory, in addition to empowering the district to construct and maintain a channel of certain dimensions and capable of producing a flow of water of certain magnitude for drainage purposes, declared such channel, when constructed, a navigable stream, and authorized the district to make, establish, lease and control docks, and also to dispose .of any water-power incidentally created in the construction of the channel: Held, that as the primary object of the act was for drainage for sanitary purposes, it was not subject to the charge of a duplicity of objects. Every intendment is in favor of the validity of the act.</p> <p>14. Where a corporation is authorized to construct channels for drainage purposes, whereby, incidentally, large and valuable water-powers may be created and opportunities afforded for the construction of valuable docks, and such valuable privileges are brought into exist- . ence, the corporation may utilize such privileges as a source of revenue, for the purpose of paying its indebtedness incurred in constructing such channel. But the power of the corporation to charge for the use of water privileges will not arise until such channel is constructed.</p> <p>15. Same\u2014who may he employed\u2014creating sanitary corporation\u2014 excluding persons not naturalized, etc. A provision in an act for the organization of sanitary districts, for the construction of important public works, prescribing the qualifications \"of persons who shall be employed on such works, is strictly germane to the general subject of constructing the works. And it is competent for the legislature to establish, as a rule of public policy, that none but citizens, or those who in good faith have taken the preliminary steps to secure naturalization, shall be employed thereon, and also to establish a test by which the good faith of persons declaring their intentions to become citizens may be determined.</p> <p>16. Equality of taxation\u2014act creating a sanitary district\u2014whether in violation of the rule of equality. An act for the formation of a sanitary district, with power to construct a channel capable of carrying a large body of water, provided that the corporation thus formed might lease water privileges and places for docks, but contained this proviso: \u201cProvided, however, nothing in this act shall be construed to abridge or prevent the State from hereafter requiring a portion of the funds derived from such water-power, dockage or wharfage to be paid into the State treasury to be used for State purposes:\u201d Held, that the proviso is not in violation of the constitution in compelling the people of one class of municipal corporations to pay more than their share of the burdens of the State government. The proviso does not attempt to divert any of the revenues of the district, but it merely declares that the State is not concluded from requiring payment to be made to it.</p> <p>17. Elections\u2014cumulative voting\u2014under an act for the election of trustees of a municipal corporation, as, in the creation of a sanitary district. A law for the organization of municipal corporations called sanitary districts, provided for the election of nine trustees, giving each voter the right to vote for as many candidates as there are trustees to elect, or the privilege of distributing his votes among not less than five-ninths of the candidates to be elected, giving each of the candidates among whom he distributes the same, the same number of votes or fractional votes: Held, that the provision was not in violation of any constitutional provision relating to suffrage.</p> <p>18. If the act had made the cumulation of votes necessary, then each voter would have been deprived of the privilege of voting, at the election, for part of the officers to be elected, and to that extent would have been excluded from his constitutional right.</p> <p>19. Judicial oeeicebs\u2014executing other than judicial duties. An act of the legislature giving the circuit or county courts the power to appoint commissioners, is a valid law; and powers and duties imposed by statute upon a circuit judge, not incompatible with his duties as judge, may be rightfully exercised by him, as, celebrating marriages, and taking the acknowledgment of deeds.</p> <p>20. So an act which imposes certain non-judicial duties upon the county judge, and two circuit judges to be selected by him, to fix the territory to be embraced by a sanitary district, prior to the submitting of the question of incorporating to a vote, is not repugnant to article S of the constitution, which distributes the powers of the government into three classes, and prohibits either branch from exercising any powers of the others.</p> <p>21. Validity oe a statute\u2014presumption. Every presumption is in favor of the validity of a statute, and every reasonable doubt must be resolved in favor of its constitutionality. The courts will never declare a statute void, except in a clear case.</p> <p>22. Whenever an act of the legislature can be so construed and applied as to avoid a conflict with the constitution, and give it the force of law, such construction should be adopted.</p>"}

EVIDENCE \u2014 Res Gestae \u2014 Statements.

The testimony of a skilled electrician as to the diffusion of light from lamps similar to those shown to have been used- in lighting the vicinity of an elevator shaft where the servant' fell and was killed, and as to the shadow .or other effects produced -thereby, due to the kind, condition, and location, is competent, on the question of proper or sufficient lighting of the place where the injury occurred.</p> <p>3. MASTER AND SERVANT \u2014 Injuries to Servant \u2014 -Fellow Servants \u2014Concurring Negligence. The master is liable for injuries due \u2019 to the concurring negligence of himself and a fellow servant in cases where the injury would probably not have occurred but for the negligence of the master.'</p> <p>4. NEGUGENCE \u2014 \u201cProximate Cause.\u201d Strictly defined, an act is the proximate cause of an event when in the natural order of things, and under the particular circumstances surrounding it, such an act would naturally produce that event.</p> <p>5. MASTER AND SERVANT \u2014 Injuries to Servant \u2014 Actions\u2014Safe Place to Work \u2014 Question for Jury. Where there is an apparent choice of routes between two points, and no rule or recognition requiring the longer route to be used, instead of the shorter, which leads across an elevator, usually left at night at a point where' it might be, and frequently is, used to cross an elevator shaft, as a means of access to a point where-the servant has duties to perform, and where it appears that others use it similarly, and that it had been so used for several months, the question as to whether notice of such use will he implied on the part of the master, and consent thereto likewise implied, is for the jury, even though it must follow that the master would owe the duty of making such passage and use reasonably safe by adequate lighting.</p> <p>6. SAME \u2014 Appliances and Place to Work \u2014 Duty of Master. It is the undelegable duty of the master to exercise ordinary care 'to provide the servant a reasonably safe place to work, reasonably safe tools and materials with which to work, and reasonably safe and competent fellow servants with whom to work, and a failure in one or more of these duties will subject the master to liability \"for all damages proximately resulting therefrom, through injuries \u25a0to the servant, even though the negligence of the fellow servant should contribute therewith to the injury, if the injury would probably not have occurred but for the negligence of the master in the performance of his duty.</p> <p>7. SAME \u2014 Place to Work \u2014 Lighting, Where a servant is required to work at night in a place or required to pass in the nighttime from one point in the premises where employed to another, it is the duty of the master to sufficiently light the locality of his work and the course of his passage to enable him to discover and avoid danger due to conditions that may be variable at different times.</p> <p>8. NEGLIGENCE \u2014 Actions\u2014Question of Law or Fact. What is or what is not negligence is ordinarily a question for the jury, and not for the court. Where the standard of duty is not fixed, but variable, and shifts with the circumstances of the case, it is incapable of being determined as a matter of law, and, where there is sufficient evidence, it must be submitted to the jury to determine . whether the duty of the master has been complied with. Oil the other hand, when the standard and measure of duty is defined by law, and is the same under ail circumstances, its omission is negligence, and may be so declared liy the court. It is only in eases where the facts are such that all reasonable men must draw the same conclusions that (he question of negligence or the want of negligence becomes one of law for the court, and then only when no recovery can be had upon any view which can properly he taken of the facts which the evidence tends to establish.</p> <p>'9.- SAME. Negligence is so much a mixed question of law and fact \u2014principally fact \u2014 that courts are seldom justified in saying that all reasonable men will agree with them on the question of whether a given state of facts constitutes the exercise of ordinary care.</p> <p>(Syllabus by Robberts, O.)</p>"}

Hoy  for relator.\n\n(1) The relator has no remedy except by writ of mandamus.

Birmingham Drain. Dist. v. Ry. Co.,  266 Mo. 60 ; Houck v. Little River Drain. Dist., 248 Mo. 373 ,  239 U.S. 254 .

Vandeventer, \nAssistant Attorney-General, for respondent.\n\n(1) The statute does not authorize the county court to levy taxes against lands in a drainage district for the sole purpose of constructing retards in the Missouri River. (a) A municipal corporation possesses such powers and such only as the State confers upon it. 28 Cyc. 257, 258, 263; Rehill v. Jersey City, 71 N.J.L. 109 ; Farwell v. Seattle,  43 Wn. 141 ; The Mayor v. Ray, 19 Wall. (86 U.S.) 475; City to use v. Eddy,  123 Mo. 546 , 557; City of Independence v. Cleveland,  167 Mo. 384 . (b) The usual drainage district, such as one organized under the Circuit Court Drainage District Act, is a public corporation, but its powers are very much less than those granted to a municipal corporation. It is at most only a  quasi -municipal corporation. Such a district is organized merely for a special and limited purpose. Its powers are restricted to such as the Legislature has deemed essential for the accomplishment of that purpose, and it is only authorized to raise funds for the specific objects mentioned in the statute. Elmore v. Drainage Comrs.,  135 Ill. 277 ; State ex rel. Caldwell v. Little Riv. Drain. Dist.,  291 Mo. 72 ; Sherwood v. Drainage District,  298 Mo. 82 ; State ex rel. Hausgen v.

(c) The county court has no power to\nstraighten, widen, alter or deepen a navigable stream. The statute limits and restricts its operation to \"natural streams &#8212; not navigable.\" Sec. 4477, Laws 1921, p. 304; Sec. 4477, R.S. 1919; State ex rel. v. Taylor,  224 Mo. 397 . (d) The main purpose contemplated by the statute is the construction of a ditch. The construction of a levee is to be an incident to the construction of the ditch. The construction of retards in the bed of a navigable river is not contemplated at all. The construction of \"permeable tree retards\" extending from one hundred to three hundred feet into the bed of the Missouri River, at right angles to its bank, are not incidents of either a ditch or levee. Certainly the construction of such retards as the sole improvement, with no provision whatever for ditches or levees, is not contemplated by the statute. Sec. 4477, Laws 1921, p. 304; Secs. 4478, 4480, 4484, R.S. 1919; Royse v. Railroad Co., 160 Ind. 592 . When the statute is read as a whole it is clear that it spends its force on the construction of ditches, together with such other works, such as levees and lateral ditches, as are necessary to make the ditches effective as channels to carry off overflow waters. In addition to the sections cited above, see Secs. 4506, 4508, 4511, 4512, 4513, 4518, 4519, 4522, R.S. 1919. See also S.W. Mo. Light Co. v. Scheurich,  174 Mo. 235 . Article 4 had its origin in the Act of 1897, Laws 1897, p. 146. Section 1 of that act provides only for the construction of \"any ditch, drain or watercourse,\" and those words have been retained in all subsequent amendments. (e) The history of Article 4 shows that the construction authorized by it was ditches to drain and reclaim swamp and overflowed lands, and such other incidental works as were necessary to make the ditches effective. Such purpose is manifested by the title of the original act and all subsequent amendments. Laws 1897, p. 146; Laws 1899, p. 278; R.S. 1899, sec. 8278 et seq.; Laws 1903, p. 234; Laws 1905, p. 180; Laws 1907, p. 341; Laws 1909, p. 632; R.S. 1909, sec. 5578 et seq.; Laws 1919, p. 294. For the\npurpose of arriving at the intention of an act, courts look to its title, and read it and every part of the act together. State v. Whitaker,  160 Mo. 69 . (f) Neither in the first report or the second report of the viewers and engineer was there any statement, nor in the order of the county court approving their first report or in the order confirming their second report, was there any finding that any of the lands in the district had ever overflowed or that they were subject to overflow. It is clear that the purpose of the proposed improvements was not to prevent the waters of the Missouri River from overflowing the lands of the district, but that the sole and only purpose was to deflect, divert and alter the current of the waters of the Missouri River and thereby prevent the erosion of the river bank. (g) There must be distinct authority of law for every levy of taxes. Taxes cannot be levied by counties or municipalities except for the very purpose, in the manner and under the conditions prescribed by law. Railroad v. Apperson,  97 Mo. 308 ; State ex rel. Clinton County v. Ry. Co.  87 Mo. 236 ; State ex rel. Aull v. Shortridge, 56 Mo. 129 ; Kansas City v. Bacon,  157 Mo. 463 . The General Assembly can grant to counties or other municipal corporations power to levy taxes \"for county and other corporate purposes,\" and for those purposes only; and the grant must be made in clear and unambiguous terms. Sec. 1, Art. 10, Mo. Constitution; City of St. Louis v. Laughlin,  49 Mo. 562 ; Brooks v. Schultz, 178 Mo. 222 . Whether the tax be a general  ad valorem  or special assessment for local improvement, it still must be for a corporate purpose. \"Every tax must rest on a public purpose to which its proceeds must be devoted.\" The power to tax \"is measured by its purposes.\" Houck v. Little Riv. Drain. Dist., 248 Mo. 384 . (h) The construction of retards in the bed of the Missouri River for the purpose of deflecting and diverting its waters is not a \"corporate purpose\" of a drainage district, for the reason that the Government of the United States\nhas jurisdiction over the bed of the river and its waters from bank to bank, and the State has no authority over its bed, and cannot interfere with its waters. To construct retards in the Missouri River, at right angles to its bank, extending one hundred feet or more into its bed, is not a corporate purpose of the State or of the county, or of a drainage district organized by the county, and a district organized for that sole and only purpose is beyond and in excess of the corporate powers of either. 8 Ency. of U.S. Supreme Ct. Rep. 815; United States v. Rio Grande Irr. Co.,  174 U.S. 703 ; Economy Light Co. v. United States,  256 U.S. 123 ; Cole v. Dooley,  137 Mich. 419 ; In re Doney Drain. Dist.,  129 Wis. 138 ; In re Horlcon Drain. Dist., 136 Wis. 227 ; Bixby v. Parish,  148 Wis. 424 ; Fulton Light, H.  P. Co. v. State,  200 N.Y. 400 . (i) The purposes for which drainage districts are created, in this State and every other State, is to reclaim wet and overflow lands, or lands subject to overflow, from surface waters, by the construction of artificial channels, levees and other works incident to efficient ditches and levees, and their operation has always been confined to such works. No statute of any State has been found that authorizes the creation of a drainage district for the sole purpose of constructing retards in a navigable stream. In every Missouri act the improvements to be constructed always include either a ditch or levee, or both. (j) The record shows that the proposed improvements are to be constructed entirely outside of the boundary lines of the drainage district. The boundary line is the north bank of the Missouri River, and the retards are to be constructed at right angles with the bank and to extend one hundred feet or more out into the bed of the river, and they are to extend from the bed of the river to the surface of the water, and are to be anchored to piling submerged entirely below the line of scour. No part of them is to be constructed within the boundary line of the district. The most that can be said of them is that their southern\nends will reach the boundary line. Such retards are not a public improvement. Low v. Mayor,  5 Cal. 214 ; Schneck v. City of Jeffersonville,  152 Ind. 214 ; Risley v. Village of Howell, 57 F. 547. (k) \"A navigable stream cannot be improved and the cost thereof levied by a special assessment upon the real estate fronting on such watercourse.\" People v. Economy Power Co., 241 Ill. 328 . (2) A numerical reference to the section sought to be amended is a sufficient title to \"an act which deals exclusively with the subject of the section to be amended.\" State v. Mullinix, 257 S.W. (Mo.) 123; State ex rel. v. Ranson,  73 Mo. 88 . But it must deal \"exclusively\" with \"the subject of the section to be amended.\" State ex rel. v. Heege,  135 Mo. 118 ; State ex rel. Park Dist. v.

State, 139 N.E. (Ind.) 182. (3) The Missouri River is a navigable stream, and Congress alone has jurisdiction over its bed and waters from bank to bank and the State of Missouri has no authority (a) to place obstructions \"not affirmatively authorized by Congress\" in its bed or to interfere with the flow of its waters at any point outside of established harbor lines; and (b) even after they have been affirmatively authorized by Congress, it is unlawful to build or commence the building of any such obstruction except upon plans recommended by the Chief of Engineers and authorized by the Secretary of War. Secs. 9 and 10 of Rivers and Harbors Act of March 3, 1899, 30 U.S. Stat. at Large, chap. 425, p. 1151. These two sections of the Act of March 3, 1899, may be summarized as follows: \"First, the creation of any obstruction to the navigable capacity of any waters of the United States\nis prohibited unless affirmatively authorized by Congress; second, it shall not be lawful to build any structure in a navigable river or water of the United States, except on plans recommended by the Chief of Engineers and authorized by the Secretary of War; and, third, it shall not be lawful to excavate or fill the channel of any navigable water of the United States unless such work is recommended by said Secretary of War prior to beginning the same.\" Hubbard v. Fort, 188 F. 992. The \"Secretary of War's authorization is a mere license to do the work, and not a grant of power to do it.\" Cobb v. Lincoln Park, 202 Ill. 437 ; Wilson v. Hudson Co. Water Co.,  76 N.J. Eq. 559 ; Lake Shore  Mich. Ry. Co. v. Ohio,  165 U.S. 368 . It is for Congress to decide what shall or shall not be deemed in judgment of law an obstruction to navigation. Philadelphia Co. v. Stinson, 223 U.S. 635 ; City of Newark v. Railroad, 287 F. 197. See also 9 Fed. Stats. Ann. (2 Ed.) pp: 36 to 56, 81 to 86; 8 Ency. U.S. Supreme Ct. Rep. p. 815. (a) It is not contended that Congress \"affirmatively authorized\" the construction of retards in the Missouri River, by a special act referring to Cambridge Bend, or by any general statute applicable thereto. There is no statute of Congress affirmatively authorizing the construction of retards in any navigable stream outside of established harbor lines, and without such affirmative authorization the creating of such an obstruction is expressly \"prohibited\" by said Section 10, even though the plans were recommended by the Chief of Engineers and authorized by the Secretary of War &#8212; and it is certain that the purported \"permit,\" signed only by a typewriter, who might have been a clerk, and done in the name of a subordinate, a colonel of engineers, Western Division, was not a recommendation of the Chief of Engineers or authorized by the Secretary of War, neither of whose names anywhere appears on the paper. (b) Congress had assumed jurisdiction by said Act of 1899, over the navigable waters of the United States\nand thereafter no obstructions could be placed in the Missouri River, except by the affirmative authorization of Congress, and all attempts by the State to divert its waters or to change its channel or otherwise interfere with the current of their flow was wholly beyond and in excess of the powers of the State. Not only had Congress by said statutes assumed jurisdiction over the navigable waters of the United States and had expressly declared that any interference therewith \"not affirmatively authorized by Congress\" was unlawful and prohibited, but the record in this case shows that the Federal Government had assumed actual jurisdiction of that very part of the Missouri River upon which the county court had originally determined to trespass and had itself begun the construction of retards \"located approximately in part of the same positions as originally planned by the district.\" On this ground alone the State Auditor was justified in refusing to register the bonds. (c) Section 9903, U.S. Compiled Statutes 1918, cited by relator does not help their case.
