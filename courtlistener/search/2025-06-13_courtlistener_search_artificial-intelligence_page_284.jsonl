Survey \u2014 Charge of court.\u2014 When the court has carefully instructed a jury as to the comparative dignity and force of calls in the grant describing a survey, the locality of which is in dispute, it is not error to instruct them that, if they cannot identify any designated corner from the evidence, it is their province to fix the lines of the survey (in subordination to the general rules which the court has described) in such a way as will most nearly harmonize the calls with known corners and marked lines identified, before them by evidence.</p> <p>5. Same \u2014 Charge of court.\u2014 When the river front of a survey was ascertained, and its upper and lower corners identified, see statement and opinion for facts which rendered it improper for the judge to charge the jury that, if they could not fix the locality of the back line with reasonable certainty, they should locate it so as that the survey would embrace the number of acres called for in the grant.</p> <p>6. Same \u2014 Calls in a grant identifying land.\u2014 When two corners of a survey are found and identified, being the upper and lower corners of the survey bordering on a stream, it is error to charge the jury that they may locate the back line with reference to the area of land which the grant, if properly located, should contain, in disregard of the distances called for in describing the side lines, in the event they could not fix the disputed portions of the lines with reasonable certainty.</p> <p>7. Survey \u2014 Calls in a grant. \u2014 A grant was located on a ,river, the upper and lower corners of which on the river were identified. The back or north line of the survey could not be identified by finding either the northwest corner, which was the second corner called for in the grant, or by certainly identifying the northeast corner by the objects called for; but a marked line was found on the proper course of the east line, prolonged beyond the disputed northeast corner. The first line called for in the grant was the west line running back from an established corner on the river. Held, that the jury should have been instructed that if they could not fix the northeast corner, nor the north or back line, by any marks or monuments, then they should fix it by courses and distances of the first and second lines of the survey, except that the second or back line should be extended so as to meet the recognized east lino as extended beyond the disputed northeast corner. Such a charge harmonizes with the rule that course controls distance, and that course and distance control quantity. Following Ayers v. Watson (Federal Reporter, March 3, 1885).</p>"}
