The acquisition of land by condemnation for a public road, and the payment of the damages awarded to the owner, will give the public the right to construct a highway over it in the mode and manner deemed most expedient, and the owner can not afterwards recover for injuries then shown that he must unquestionably suffer; but such condemnation is no bar to a suit by the land owner for a subsequent injury growing out of negligence and unskillfulness in the public authorities in constructing drains in the highway, resulting in serious injury to the owner.</p> <p>4.

{"absolute_url": "/opinion/3543783/yazoo-city-v-loggins/", "attorney": "J.G. Holmes,  for appellant.\n\nI. The evidence affirmatively shows that the city was free from any negligence. \"Municipalities are required to exercise only ordinary care to keep and maintain their streets and sidewalks in a reasonably safe condition.\"  Vicksburg  v.

Burnsville,   113 Miss. 219 . \"If a suitable warning has been erected by a third person in the performance of the work, it relieves the municipality from the necessity of taking a like precaution, and the municipality may avail itself in its defense of the warning placed by the author of the danger, or others.\" 6 McQuillin, Municipal Corporations, section 2802;  Stockton Automobile Co.  v.  Confer,   154 Cal. 402 , 97 P. 881 ;  Kansas City  v.  Birmingham,   45 Kan. 212 , 25 P. 569;  Walker  v.

Detroit,   142 Mich. 331 , 106 N.W. 888.\n\nII. The jury on their  voir dire  examination were improperly informed that the city was insured against liability. 36 C.J., page 1128;  Herrin, Lambert  Co.  v.  Daly,   80 Miss. 340 ; Stratton  v.  C.H. Nichols Lbr. Co.,   39 Wn. 322 , 109 A.S.R. 881, 81 P. 831;  Hoyt  v.  Davis Mfg. Co.,   112 App. Div. 755 , 98 N.Y. Supp. 1031;  Mithen  v.  Jeffrey,   259 Ill. 372 , 103 N.E. 778 .\n\nIII. It was error to admit the opinion evidence of appellee's witness, Jack Manning. In  I.C.R.R. Co.  v.  Short,   113 Miss. 272 ;   R.R. Co.  v.  Spencer,   72 Miss. 502 ; and  Merchants' Wharf  Boat Ass'n  v.  Wood et al.  (Miss.), 3 So. 248, the supreme court of Mississippi has condemned opinion evidence where the witness is not shown to have been qualified by reason of some superior expert knowledge or observation, or experience.\n\nIV. It was error to admit the hearsay testimony of appellee's witness, J.W. Willoughby, as to statements made by L.A. Underwood.\n\nV. The verdict of the jury is excessive. The injuries which appellee sustained were to his right leg. About thirteen years prior to the accident involved in this case, appellee's right leg had been amputated several inches below the knee, as a result of injuries sustained while an employee of the A.  V. Railroad Company at Vicksburg. Six years after these injuries were sustained, he had a second operation as a result of his previous injuries. During the period of thirteen years he had been using an artificial limb. The injuries in this case resulted in a fracture of the leg above the knee.\n\nThe doctor who made the X-ray examination of the leg, while denominating the injuries as permanent, says that he would not state that the plaintiff would be for all time incapacitated. He states further that in his opinion the appellee might resume the use of the artificial limb, although he states that it might give him some discomfort.\n\n Watkins, Watkins  Eager,  also, for appellant.\n\nThe court erred in refusing to grant the directed verdict requested by defendant. The rule is too elementary to require the citation of authority that a municipality is not an insurer of its streets but is liable only for the failure to use ordinary or reasonable care and precaution in respect to the same. As we view the testimony of this case, the only theory upon which it can be said that the case should have been submitted to the jury would be that a municipality is an insurer against injuries sustained on account of defects in its streets or sidewalks. This is clearly not the rule but the municipality is required to exercise only ordinary care in the guarding or warning of dangerous places.\n\nThe learned trial court overlooked the fact that the object of a warning light is to warn persons of the danger and to prevent their close approach. It is not the purpose of the warning signal to provide sufficient light so\nthat one may cross the point of danger in safety. Thus it was held in  Stacy  v.  Phelps,  47 Hun. (N.Y.) 54, that since the object of a guard is merely to warn travelers and not absolutely to prevent contact with the danger, a municipality was not liable for injuries caused by the fall of a runaway team into an unguarded excavation since a guard would not have prevented the accident. 13 R.C.L., par. 356; 29 C.J., page 688, par. 452.\n\nThe appellant also had the right to avail itself of the benefit of the action taken by the private contractor Jenne in guarding the excavation on the sidewalk by placing a signal lantern, with like effect and to the same effect as though the appellant had itself put out the signal.  Stockton Automobile Co.  v.  Confer,  97 P. 881 .\n\nHearsay testimony on the part of Mr. Willoughby falls far short from proving any notice to the city that a proper signal which had been duly placed at the scene of the accident had become extinguished in some unknown manner only a few minutes prior to the accident. 29 C.J., 718, par. 486. In the case at bar there is no conflicting evidence as to the placing of the signal lantern nor its sufficiency.\n\nThis court in  Meridian  v.  Hyde  (Miss.), 11 So. 108, has indirectly passed upon a similar question to that at bar. It has been universally held that a municipality is not liable for injury resulting from defects of its streets or on its sidewalks where the warning signal or barrier has been removed without its knowledge. 29 C.J., par. 452, page 690.\n\nIn the case at bar the city not only did not have notice that the signal lantern had become extinguished, but on the other hand one of its employees, Mr. Adams, had walked along Filmore street only a few minutes before the accident occurred and testified that at that time both lights were burning brightly and furnishing a sufficient warning of the danger.  Dooley  v.  Town  of Sullivan, Ind.,  14 N.E. 566;  Doherty  v.  Waltham,  4 Gray 596; Shear  R. Neg., par. 360; 13 R.C.L., par. 360 at page 440.\n\nIt is sufficient if a plain warning of danger is given and the traveler has notice or knowledge of facts sufficient to put him on inquiry. In the case at bar all the evidence forcibly and conclusively demonstrates that had it not been for the fact that the lantern placed on the sidewalk had become extinguished in some unknown manner a few minutes before Mr. Loggins' unfortunate accident, the injury never would have occurred.\n\nThe record also discloses that on the night in question this particular lantern was filled with oil and was in good condition and, therefore, the fact that it had become extinguished was no fault of the contractor or the appellant. With such testimony, it is our view that there was no question of conflict in fact to be submitted to the jury for decision, and the failure of the trial judge to grant the directed verdict was manifest error. 13 R.C.L., par. 361, page 442. As to what constitutes a sufficient warning, see:  Dooley  v.  Sullivan, supra;  19 R.C.L. (N.S.) 509 and note;  Ferguson  v.  City of Des Moines,  128 N.W. 40; Tegtmier  v.  City of Covington  (Ky.), 207 S.W. 382;  Kendall \nv.  City of Des Moines,  167 N.W. 684;  Gatewood  v.  City of  Frankfort,  185 S.W. 847,  170 Ky. 292 ;  Carlson  v.  City of New  York,  134 N.Y.S. 661,  150 App. Div. 264 ;  City of Portsmouth  v. Lee,  71 S.E. 630,  112 Va. 419 ;  Frohs  v.  City of Dubuque, \n150 N.W. 62,  169 Iowa 431 ;  McDonald  v.  Degnon-McLean  Contracting Co.,  109 N.Y.S. 519,  124 App. Div. 824 ;  Mosier  v. East Stroudsburg, Borough,   53 Pa. Super. 377 .\n\nFor Mississippi cases decided upon the question of the liability of a municipality for injuries on account of defects or dangerous places in its streets or sidewalks, see:  Atkinson  v. Town of Decatur,   131 Miss. 707 , 95 So. 689;  McComb  v. Hayman,   124 Miss. 525 , 87 So. 11;  City of Hattiesburg  v. Reynolds,   124 Miss. 352 , 86 So. 853;  City of Greenville  v. Middleton,   124 Miss. 310 , 86 So. 804,  Saxon  v.  Town of  Houlka,   107 Miss. 161 , 65 So. 124;  Jordan  v.  City of  Lexington,   133 Miss. 440 , 97 So. 758;  Dahmer \nv.  City of Meridian,   111 Miss. 208 , 71 So. 321;  Meridian  v. Hyde  (Miss.), 11 So. 108.\n\nThe trial judge after refusing to grant the directed instruction, stated that while he considered it his duty to submit the case to the jury, he was not at all certain that his ruling was correct.\n\nThe trial court was in error.\n\n Wise  Bridgforth  and  Barbour  Henry,  for appellee.\n\nI. Appellant argues that the peremptory instruction should have been given. Counsel wholly misconceive the testimony as it shows sharp and direct conflict as to whether the lantern on the sidewalk was ever lighted. The jury has by its verdict found that it never was; and with ample evidence to support this finding, it will not be disturbed.\n\nA further conflict is the fact that both Logan and Jenne testified a lantern of the character used would not go out, and the one in the street did not. Then too, common sense tells us that a lantern when burning consumes oil. If this excellent one had burned from five o'clock until nearly eight, as claimed, it would have consumed a part of the oil, as Logan testified that both lamps were full of oil when he lit them and Mr. Jenne, the plumber, on arriving just in time to see the ambulance take the injured man away, took the lantern which was not burning and carried it to the city's fire station, where there was a good light, and carefully examined it. When so examined, he found it \"full of oil.\"\n\nWe submit that the fact has been found on disputed testimony that the trench across the sidewalk was left open, and never guarded with a lantern, or any other method of warning and continued so, from the afternoon until the appellee fell into it. If this is true the authorities cited by the appellant do not help them and we have no complaint to make of them.\n\nDid the appellant have knowledge of the trench? There was direct and convincing proof that the city's street commissioner had actual knowledge of the existence of the trench. The existence or absence of knowledge may be shown by declarations of the person whose knowledge is of importance; even though such declarations were made a considerable time before or after the time involved in the inquiry provided there is not such an element of remoteness as destroys materiality. 10 R.C.L. 938; 16 Cyc. 1176;  Boyd  v.  Ricketts,   60 Miss. 62 ; 38 Cyc. 1398. To the same effect is 26 R.C.L., par. 53, page 1046.\n\nThis court is in agreement with those holding hearsay evidence, unobjected to, constituting proof, as shown by the following decisions, some of which are directly in point, and other argumentatively so:  Exum  v.  Brister,   35 Miss. 397 ;  Edge  v. Keith,  13 S.  M. 300;  Commercial Bank  v.  Martin,  9 S.  M. 613;  Clinton  v.  Laird,  12 S.  M. 568;  McComb  v.  Turner, \n14 S.  M. 119;  Union  Planters Bank  v.  Rylee,   130 Miss. 892 ;   N.O.  C.R.R. Co.  v.  Mauldin,   103 Miss. 244 ,  Palmer  v. Fair Co.,   105 So. 513 .\n\nThe following cases also support our contention:  135 P. 373 ; 152 P. 347 ; 248 S.W. 205;  235 S.W. 126 ;  261 S.W. 380 ; citing Wigmore. One of the latest cases is  Poluski  v.  Glen Alden Coal  Co.,   133 A. 819 .\n\nThe authorities seem unanimous that a failure to object to incompetent evidence, followed by a cross-examination thereon is a complete waiver and admission of such evidence and cannot be complained of on appeal. 26 R.C.L. 1052, and cases cited at note 19.\n\n(a) It is manifest that the street commissioner was acting as such and the negligent act or thing was in operation when he made the statement.  I.C.R.R. Co.  v.  Fronstine Co.,   64 Miss. 834 , is directly in point. The case of  R.R. Co.  v.  Jones,   73 Miss. 229 , is also conclusive.  M.  O.R.R. Co.  v.  Stinson,   74 Miss. 453 , is to the same effect and conclusive.\n\n(b) The statement of Underwood was made while he was the agent of the city and while the negligent act was in operation. That it was competent on this theory is supported by 22 C.J. 377; 10 R.C.L. 989;  M.  O.R.R. Co.  v.  Stinson,   74 Miss. 453 ;  Y.   M.V.R.R. Co.  v.  Jones,   73 Miss. 229 ;  Fronstine  v.  R.R.  Co.,   64 Miss. 834 ;  Dickman  v.  Williams,   50 Miss. 834 ;  W.U.  Tel. Co.  v.  Waters,   106 Miss. 59 ;  Pennington  v.  Bank,  132 Miss. 23 .\n\nThe case was properly submitted to jury.\n\nII. If a dangerous place is properly guarded by barriers and signals by those in charge of the work in the street, the city will be protected in the same manner as if such guards and signals had been placed there by it.  Dooley  v.  Sullivan,  112 Ind. 451 , 14 N.E. 566;  Kansas City  v.  Birmingham,  45 Kan. 212 , 25 P. 569;  Walker  v.  Ann Arbor,   111 Mich. 1 , 69 Mo. 87. But on the other hand, if the municipality trust to others to see that guards, or covering, are properly kept up, it will be liable for the consequences of their negligence, although the barriers are down but temporarily.  Blessington  v.  Boston,  153 Mass. 409 , 26 N.E. 1113;  Prentiss  v.  Boston,   112 Mass. 43 ; Boston  v.  Coon,   175 Mass. 283 ,  56 N.E. 287 ;  Pace  v. Webster City  (Iowa),  138 Iowa 107 , 115 N.W. 888. To like effect, see,  Sterling  v.  Thomas,   60 Ill. 264 ;  Pettengill  v. Yonkers,   116 N.Y. 558 , 15 A.S.R. 442;  Foy  v.  City of  Winston  (N.C.),  35 S.E. 609 ;  City of Glascow  v.  Gillenwaters \n(Ky.), 67 S.W. 381;  Woodman  v.  Metropolitan R.R. Co.,  149 Mass. 339 , 21 N.E. 482; 28 Cyc. 1402.\n\nIII. Examination of jurors on their  voir dire.  The jury when presented to plaintiff's counsel contained a Mr. Ford, known to counsel only as an insurance agent of some kind. The counsel for plaintiff knew there was some insurance company indemnifying the appellant in this case. In absolute faith good faith, he asked Mr. Ford if the company employing him was engaged in\nthe business of writing \"insurance to pay judgment sustained in suits.\" It is seldom that a damage suit is presented to this court, that the matter here discussed is not pressed.  Yazoo  City  v.  Birchett,   89 Miss. 700 ;  La. Oil Cor.  v.  Farish, \n109 So. 30;  Beatty  v.  Palmer,  71 So. (Ala.) 423; 35 C.J.,\n\nIV. Evidence of witness Manning: Wigmore's revision of Greenleaf (16 Ed.), at page 550; 22 C.J., 518-19, at section 605, Treatise on Evidence; Chamberlayne's The Modern Law of Evidence, section 1834.\n\nV. The verdict was not excessive. The plaintiff was thirty-eight years of age at the time and earning from forty or forty-five dollars per week. It is true that the injured leg, due to an accident many years ago, had been amputated below the knee, but there had been a complete recovery, the plaintiff walked with an artificial limb, was able to follow his vocation as a barber, and earned what many men with two legs cannot earn.\n\nThe proof shows without dispute that the large bone of the leg was crushed and one portion of it driven into the other, so that at the time of the trial it had not united, and Dr. Day testified that the condition constituted a permanent injury.  City of  Greenville  v.  Middleton,   124 Miss. 310 ;  A.  V.R.R. Co.  v. McGee,   117 Miss. 370 ,  Y.  M.V.R.R. Co.  v.  Mothershed,  122 Miss. 835 ;  Y.  M.V.R.R. Co.  v.

No error. \n\nThe facts as alleged in the second substituted complaint and deemed to be admitted by the demurrer, are as follows: &#8212;\n\nThe plaintiff had been engaged for more than fifteen years as railway brakeman and baggage-master upon the defendant's road, and claimed, by his observation, experience and study, to have acquired valuable ideas with reference to the operation of railroads. On or about January 19th, 1914, the defendant was informed by the plaintiff that he had information of value in the operation of the defendant's road, by which, if applied by the defendant, it could earn at least $100,000 a year therefrom without any expense on the part of the defendant, and that the plaintiff would furnish the defendant this information for a valuable consideration. An appointment was made and on or about February 9th, 1914, the plaintiff and the defendant, the latter acting by one of its vice-presidents and another officer, met and entered into an oral agreement by which it was contracted and agreed that if the plaintiff would submit his proposition and if said proposition was adopted and acted upon by the defendant, the plaintiff should receive, as compensation for imparting said information, a percentage of the receipts therefrom equal to the percentage ordinarily charged by real-estate brokers upon rentals and sales effected by them, which said usual real-estate commission was five per cent. Thereupon, the plaintiff, in reliance upon the agreement, submitted and imparted to the defendant his proposition, to wit: \"The selling of advertising space by the defendant and the displaying by it of advertisements\non its railway stations, depots, rights of way, cars and fences.\" The plaintiff further alleged that the defendant, by its officers, further agreed, as part consideration for the information furnished it, to employ the plaintiff to take charge of said advertising. The defendant immediately adopted and acted upon said proposition and sold advertising space as proposed, in its railway stations, depots, rights of way, cars and fences. Prior thereto the defendant had not sold advertising space or displayed advertisements as above. By reason of so selling advertising space and displaying advertisements, the defendant has made several millions of dollars, and will continue to earn similar large sums in the future. The defendant has refused to live up to its agreement, nothing has been paid, and the defendant has not employed the plaintiff and has expressly refused to allow the plaintiff to take charge of the advertising, though the plaintiff has always been ready and willing to take such charge.\n\nTo the complaint setting out the facts as in substance stated, the defendant filed a demurrer as follows: &#8212;\n\n\"1. It appears that the terms of the alleged agreement are vague, uncertain, and incapable of ascertainment or enforcement, and that by reason thereof no contract was ever made between the plaintiff and the defendant.\n\n\"2. It does not appear with respect to the allegations of paragraph 6 to the effect that the defendant agreed to employ the plaintiff to take charge of said advertising, for what time or for what pay, if any, said plaintiff should be employed, and the terms of said alleged agreement are too indefinite, vague, uncertain, and indeterminate to constitute a contract of employment.\n\n\"3. It appears that the information or suggestion given by the plaintiff to the defendant was not secret\nor exclusive information in the knowledge of the plaintiff, but such as is perfectly obvious and well known to all men, and could not possibly be of advantage to the defendant, or have any market value so as to form the consideration for a contract.\n\n\"4. It does not appear that the information given or plan suggested was not already in the possession of the defendant, and a matter of common knowledge.\n\n\"5. It does not appear that the plaintiff's idea, plan or process, is, or could be, property, or constitute consideration for a promise.\"\n\nThe defendant also filed a motion which it is unnecessary to consider. The court sustained the demurrer pro forma.  Judgment was rendered for the defendant, and the case comes to this court on the demurrer to the second substituted complaint.", "procedural_history": "", "scdb_id": "", "sibling_ids": [3323436], "source": "ZU", "status": "Published", "suitNature": "", "syllabus": ""}
