This act contains no provision for the compensation of dissenting stockholders. It was assumed that the Northern Railroad had notice of the proposed passage of this statute. On June 18, 1884, the stockholders of the Northern Railroad, by a vote of more than two thirds, approved a lease to the Boston  Lowell. On the same day, pursuant to this vote, the Northern Railroad, by its president, executed to the Boston  Lowell Railroad a lease for ninety-nine years, of the railroad, rolling-stock, etc., of the lessor, the lessee to pay a specified quarterly rental, and perform various other covenants. The plaintiffs voted against approving the lease, and seasonably filed their bill in equity, praying that the Boston  Lowell Railroad be enjoined from operating the Northern Railroad under the lease, and that the Northern Railroad and its directors be ordered to assume the management of the road.", "procedural_history": "", "scdb_id": "", "sibling_ids": [3553561], "source": "ZU", "status": "Published", "suitNature": "", "syllabus": ""}
