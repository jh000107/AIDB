Taylor,  Judge. \n\nJames Holmes was convicted of murder, and appeals. Affirmed.\n\nOn the 3d day of April, 1911, in the district court of Oklahoma county, the following verdict was returned against appellant:\n\n\"We, the jury, drawn, impaneled, and sworn in the above-entitled cause, do upon our oaths find the defendant, James Holmes, guilty of murder in the manner and form as charged in the information, and fix his punishment at death. T.D. Turner, Foreman.\"\n\nOn the 24th day of April, 1911, sentence of death was pronounced against the defendant by the court in accordance with said verdict. Appellant appealed.\n\nThe first witness for the state was Miss Kate O'Mara. She testified: That on the 8th day of March, 1911, she lived at 214 East Third street in the city of Oklahoma. At about 1:30 o`clock that night she heard some one coming up Third street whistling. This person then began to sing. She wondered who was singing so loudly at that hour of the night, and got up to see. By the time she had got to the window, the singer had passed. Only one person\nwas whistling and singing. Soon after this she heard some shuffling of feet on the sidewalk. That this noise was made by more than one person, and was pretty loud. She next heard a muffled scream. Soon after this she heard one shot. She looked out of the window again, and about one minute after the shot was fired she saw four persons in the street. Two were going west on Third street. One was in the center of the street, and the fourth person ran through her yard between the hydrant and the porch and ran to the alley. That she did not see these persons until about a minute after the shot was fired. That the parties had their heads down and were running, and witness was unable to recognize them. The next morning between 4 and 5 o'clock she saw a man lying out on the sidewalk. There was a large crowd there. There was a great pool of blood where the man was lying that had run down several feet on the pavement. The shot which she heard the night before was in the direction of the place where the man was lying.\n\nH.E. Harris testified: That he lived at 220 East Third street. That on the 9th of March, 1911, about 1 o'clock at night, he heard some one singing, but did not pay any attention to it. That soon after this a noise was started up. That he first thought there were cats around the back yard, but he pretty soon discovered a man's voice or probably two men's voices. He then heard a gun shot. The windows were all down, and he could not distinguish exactly where the noise was. He got up, put on his clothes, and walked out in the back yard, and looked in his barn to see if his horse was all right, and walked around in the alley. He did not see or hear anything or anybody and the lights were out and he went back to bed. He got up about 4:30 o'clock the next morning, saw a man lying dead on the sidewalk, his pants pockets wrong side out. Blood appeared to run from the dead man's head down the street about 30 feet.\n\nE.T. Bryan testified: That he resided at 214 East Third street in the city of Oklahoma. That about 1:30 o'clock on the night of the 8th of March he heard a shot, and soon after the shot was fired he heard running. He did not hear the running\nuntil two or three minutes after the shot was fired. It was dark, and witness could not see any one. He got up the next morning, and found a man lying dead on the sidewalk. The man was lying between 214 and 216 East Third street. The man was shot in the left side of the head, right through the ear.\n\nCharles Bersha testified: That about 4 o'clock on the morning of the 9th of March, 1911, he had occasion to be on East Third street in the 200 block. He saw a man lying dead on the sidewalk. The man had a wound in the left side of his head. Blood ran down from the wound something like 35 or 40 feet. That witness then phoned to the police department.\n\nD.M. Ely testified that on the morning of the 9th of March, 1911, he saw a man lying in block 200 on East Third street in the city of Oklahoma. He identified the dead body as that of W.H. Archie. His pants pockets were turned wrong side out. The man was shot in the left side of the head. Blood ran down on the pavement about 30 feet.\n\nB.Z. Hutchinson testified that he was acquainted with W.H. Archie during his lifetime, said Archie being in the employ of the witness, and having been in such employment for 2 1/2 years. Witness identified the body of the dead man as that of W.H. Archie.\n\nCharley Goodall testified: That he was acquainted with W.H. Archie in his lifetime, and occupied the same room with him. That the deceased was in the habit of carrying some money on him all of the time. That on the evening of the 8th of March, 1911, he saw him take a roll of money out of his clothes, and saw him place a roll of money in his pockets. He thought the deceased had at least $50 or $60 which was in currency. Deceased also had a watch. It was an open-faced gold case watch. Witness then identified a watch handed him as the watch that belonged to Archie in his lifetime.\n\nAdolph Frankel testified: That he was engaged in the merchandise and loan business in the city of Oklahoma at 3 1/2 West California street. That between 10 and 1 o'clock that day Bud Johnson, one of the parties accused of the murder of W.H.\nArchie, came into his place of business, and pawned a watch to him for $6.25. Witness here identified the watch pawned to him by the said Johnson.\n\nG.W. Morgan testified: That he was present in Justice Hawkins' courtroom when the defendant was arraigned. That the witness heard a conversation between the county attorney and the defendant James Holmes and the other persons charged with the murder of W.H. Archie. That they told the county attorney that they were at the Alabama Hotel, and they went north from the Alabama Hotel up to Second street, and they saw a white man going east. They ran up to this white man, and one of them ran around and stuck a gun in his face, and told him to throw up, and he had his hands in his pockets, and he backed up against a post, and at that moment they grabbed him and threw him down, and, as he fell &#8212; it seems he had his money in a little tobacco sack, and it fell out on the ground &#8212; they picked it up, and there was a shot fired, and they all ran. That the defendants were all talking. That first one would start to tell how it was done and another would correct him. That the defendant Elijah Turner said he was not present when the shot was fired, but had run a little piece away, and the defendant James Holmes turned to Turner, and said: \"Why, you were there with the rest of us.\"\n\nL.K. Reynolds testified: That he was present in Justice Hawkins' court when the preliminary information was read to the defendant James Holmes when he was charged with the murder of W.H. Archie. That the defendant, Holmes, pleaded guilty to said charge at said preliminary trial. That all of the other defendants were present when the defendant Holmes pleaded guilty to said charge. That the witness heard all of the defendants talking about this trouble. That all of the defendants took part in the conversation. The defendant Holmes stated they got between $80 and $85 off of deceased Archie, which was divided up between Posey and Prather. That the other defendants got $5 apiece, and that Bud Johnson got the watch.\n\nDr. John W. Riley testified as to the nature of the wounds\non the person of the deceased, and that they were the cause of his death.\n\nW.P. Hawkins testified: That he was a justice of the peace in the city of Oklahoma. That he heard the preliminary examination of the defendant charged with the murder of Archie on the 15th day of March, 1911. That, when the information charging the defendant with the murder of W.H. Archie was read to the defendant Holmes, he entered a plea of guilty to said charge. That, after the defendants had all pleaded guilty, the witness heard a statement made by the defendants with reference to the murder of Archie. They all stated they were there, and gave a description of what occurred. They said that, when \"they got to the corner of Second and Walnut, they seen this man walking ahead of them on the east side of Walnut street between Second and Third street. As they got down about the middle of the block somewhere, they caught up with him, and Prather steps in front of him and threw the gun in his face, and told him to hold up his hands. The rest of them grabbed him. He resisted and hollered, and they got him down and took his money away from him and his watch, and, after they had done that, while they were still holding him, Prather shot him.\n\n\"Q. Do you remember anything particular that Elijah Turner said in the presence of James Holmes with reference to this charge? A. Why, Elijah Turner made a statement of his own that, when the man hollered, he ran, and he got up at the corner or just around the corner when he heard a shot fired. Q. State whether or not there was any response to that statement by either one of the defendants, and, if so, by whom? A. Well, the one with a wart or mole on his lip told him &#8212; he says, `You was right there and holding him or helping to hold him.' That was at the time the shot was fired. Q. I wish you would look at this young man, and state to the jury whether or not that is the man that made that statement? A. That is the man that made the statement. Yes, sir.\"\n\nWitness identified defendant Holmes as the person who made this statement.\n\nPeter Biewer testified: That he was connected with the police force in the city of Oklahoma, and was assistant in the\nbureau of identification. He testified that the appellant voluntarily made the following statement to him:\n\n\"He told me that he had started from the Alabama Hotel with Charlie Posey, John Henry Prather, alias Blue, and Cy Booker. This was about 8 p.m. on the night of March 8, 1911. They went north of Stiles to Eighth street, and turned east to Geary. At Eighth and Geary they run on a young white man. Blue stuck the gun under him, and he and Cy Booker went through his pockets, got about $2.15. They then came back to the Alabama Hotel, and got Bud Johnson. This was about midnight. They went up Walnut street to Second. Then in the middle of the block between Second and Third on Walnut they saw a white man going north, and Blue said, `Let's get him,' and the white man turned on the south side of East Third street, and about the center of the block, and Prather went up in front of him, and stuck the gun on him, and told him to hold up his hands, and the man didn't do it, and kinder backed away. Q. He, who do you mean? A. James Holmes and Cy Booker and Bud Johnson and Posey grabbed him, and threw him down, and Posey searched him, and that Blue stood off and held the gun on him; that Posey searched him and taken his money. He said after he taken that money, he said, Blue put up the gun to the man's head and fired. He said, `We'll all run.' He said, `I ran with the rest of the boys.' They went back to the Hole on Second street. The Hole was closed, and they all went to the Alabama Hotel where they divided the money. He said he had gotten $5. Then Holmes went upstairs and went to bed. He said he saw Posey the next day, that Posey had said he had the gun; that Blue had given him back his gun, and that Bud Johnson got the watch.\"\n\nThe witness further testified that later in the day the defendant repeated this statement to him as above set forth; that the witness kept a memorandum of the statement made by the defendant.\n\nHarry Stege testified that he belonged to the police department of the city of Oklahoma; that he was working in the secret service department. He stated that he heard the defendant Holmes make the following statement:\n\n\"He said they went up to Eighth and Geary, and held up a white man, Posey and Blue, Cy Booker, and himself. They got $2.15. He said that was a young white man, light complected,\nwell dressed. The man made no resistance. They went down to the Alabama Hotel and they got Bud. They went up Walnut street, I think Third or Second street. They seen a white man turn going on the south side of Third street, and Blue said I am going to throw the gun on him. Blue went up in front of him, put the gun on him, and told him to hold up. The man refused to do so. He resisted, and they all grabbed hold of him and threw him down, and Posey searched him, and, when Posey said he had got the money, they all let loose of him, and started to run, but in the meantime Blue was standing off a little ways with the gun, and, after Posey got the money, some of the boys started to run. He said he, Holmes, was standing right alongside of the man, when Blue went up to the man, pushed the gun into the man's head, and fired. He run away with Blue then, and he asked Blue why he wanted to kill the man after they had got his money, and the man was making no resistance. Blue said he just wanted to kill a white man anyhow. He said they went down Walnut street to the Alabama Hotel, to the Hole, that is where they went first, but it was closed, and they went back over to the Alabama Hotel. Blue had some money given him by Charlie Posey, and then he gave him $5, and they disbanded.\"\n\nShirley Dyer testified that he was chief of the secret service department of the police force of Oklahoma City. He stated that he had a conversation with the defendant Holmes with reference to the killing of the deceased, Archie, and that in that conversation Holmes stated to the witness that about 8 o'clock on the evening of March 8th himself, Cy Booker, Prather, or Blue, and Charlie Posey went north to Eighth street. There they turned and went east to somewhere near Eighth and Geary. \"If I remember right, met a white man, a young fellow dressed in a light suit of clothes.\" That Blue shoved the gun in his face, and told him to throw up his hands. That he did, did not resist, and that he searched him (\"meaning the defendant if I am not mistaken\") and got $2.15.\n\n\"They then went back to the Alabama Hotel, divided the proceeds, I believe, and later they got hold of Bud Johnson, who was there at that time and went out again, went over to the Hole in the Wall. From there they went west on Second street, and they saw a white man turn east on Third on the south side, and Blue pulls out his gun (meaning John Henry Prather), and said,\n`Boys, let's get him.' Blue went around in front of him, shoved the gun in his face, and the man refused to give up, and we all grabbed him and threw him down. That Posey went through the white man and got his money. That, when Posey said, `I have got it,' that they all run. He said he was standing near the white man who had raised on his elbow getting up when John Henry Prather, alias Blue, shot him. Hollering for help, the white man was, and he saw him fall back and kick a little. That he asked Blue what he shot him for after he had stopped struggling, and he said he wanted to kill a man anyhow. They went back to the Hole in the Wall, and it was closed, and from there they went to the Alabama Hotel and that Blue, I believe it was, gave him $5 which he said he had gotten from Posey, and that he then went to bed. Said he thought Blue gave Posey back his gun. The next day he met Posey, and Posey told him that he was going to Memphis, and that Blue had given him his gun. As near as I can remember, that is about his confession.\"\n\nThe state then introduced the written confession of the defendant Holmes, which is as follows:\n\n\"I started from the Alabama Hotel in company with Charles Posey, Cy Booker, and John Henry Prather, alias Blue, at about 8 p.m., on the evening of March 8, 1911. We walked north, and, when we got to East Eighth street, we went east. About the corner of Eighth and Geary we met a white man. Blue had borrowed Charles Posey's pistol, a shiny barrelled 44-caliber gun, and he pushed it in the man's face, and ordered him to throw up his hands. The man made no resistance, and I and Cy Booker went through his pockets and got $2.15. He was a young man well dressed, light complected. We went down Geary to the Alabama Hotel, and got hold of Bud Johnson, and told him to come with us and get a little easy money. We then went up to Walnut street and saw a man, a white man, going north between Second and Third streets. He turned down Third street on the south side of the street. Blue pulled out his pistol, and said to us boys, `Let's go and get him.' Blue went up to him, and shoved the gun to his head, and told him to throw up his hands. The man refused to do so, and all of us boys grabbed him, and threw him down while Blue stepped a little ways off with the pistol. Charles Posey went through his pockets and got considerable money. I don't quite know how much. When Posey said he had the money, we all started to run. I was standing right close to the white man, who was on his elbows on the ground just\ngetting up. He was shouting for help, and Blue, who had the pistol, pointed it at his head, and fired. I saw the man fall back and kick about a little. Then I ran with the rest of the boys. I asked Blue why he had shot the man after he had stopped struggling, and he said, `I just wanted to kill a man, anyhow.' We went back to the Hole on East Second street, but it was closed, and so we went to the Alabama Hotel. Blue had the money which Charles Posey had turned over to him, and he gave me $5. I then went upstairs and went to bed. I think that Blue gave Charles Posey back his gun at the Alabama Hotel that night. Blue had carried it all day. I saw Charles Posey on March 11th. He said that he was going to Memphis. He showed me his gun, and said that Blue had returned it to him. Blue shot the white man about 1 a.m. in the morning of March 9th. State of Oklahoma. Oklahoma County. I, James Holmes, being first duly sworn according to law, depose, and state that I have read the above and foregoing statement and that the matters and things therein set forth are true. [Signed] James Holmes. Subscribed and sworn to before me this 12th day of March, A.D. 1911. W.R. Gorby, Notary Public. [Seal] My commission expires Jan. 6, 1913.\"\n\nThe state then rested.\n\nThe defendant placed several witnesses upon the stand who testified that they had known him for a number of years, and that he had the general reputation of being a quiet, peaceable, and law-abiding man. The defendant testified in his own behalf as follows:\n\n\"Well, on March 8th, me and some more boys started north from the Alabama Hotel early, about 8 o'clock in the evening. We went north on Stiles. We got up about Seventh or Eighth street. We turned east or west toward Geary. After we went middle ways of the block, we met a white man, and, when we met him, Prather, as we started, passed by him, pulled out a revolver, stuck it in his face, and told him to throw up his hands. He made no resistance, and me and another boy went through his pockets and got $2.15. Then we went back down Geary to the Alabama Hotel. We got there, and Bud Johnson was with us. Then we set around there a while, played some music around there, bought some whisky. Then we went back over to the place they call the Hole, a pool hall over on Second street; went back over there and it was closed. We stayed there a while. Then we went up Second street to Walnut. We got near to\nWalnut, and we seen a man going north on Walnut. Then Prather said, `Come on, let's get him.' We started north behind the man and overtaken him just around the corner on Third from Walnut and Third and between Stiles and Central &#8212; no; Central and Walnut. Prather walks around in front of the man, and throws the gun on him, told him to throw up his hands. He kinder backed off from him, and Posey and some more of the boys grabbed hold of him and threw him down. Prather stood off a little ways with the pistol in his hand, and the man began to yell. Posey said, `Come on, let's let him alone.' Then we all broke and run. Prather, when I left him, Prather was still standing there over the man with the revolver, and then, as I started, I told Prather to come on away, let the man alone. He might let the gun go off accidentally. Prather was still standing there as I started on away. As I turned my back, I heard the gun fire, and I looked around, and I seen the man kinder fall back and kick a little. I broke in a run and caught up with the other boys. Posey and Turner was just a little ahead of me, and we all run down Walnut. Prather caught up with us. After we turned east on Second, I asked him did he shoot the man. He said, `Yes.' I asked him why did he want to shoot the man. `Well,' he says, `just because I wanted to kill a man anyhow.' We never said any more then. We went on down. After we crossed Central, Prather and Turner and Posey were in front, and Bud Johnson and I were behind, walking along talking.

TRIAL \u2014 Instructions\u2014Character of Accused, (a) A general instruction upon the subject of character is ail that the court should give in the trial of a criminal case, and, even although a defendant may introduce evidence of a previous good character, yet, if the facts and circumstances in the case are such that such evidence could not be of benefit to the defendant, it is not error for the trial court to refuse to instruct upon this subject.</p> <p>2. EVIDENCE \u2014 Appeal.\u2014Confessions\u2014Harmless Error, (a) Where it is proven that confessions of the defendant were freely and voluntarily made, they are competent evidence against him.</p> <p>(b) Even although the court may have erred in admitting evidence of a confession made by a defendant, yet if the defendant takes the witness stand in his own behalf, and testifies to the truthfulness of every material statement contained in said confession so erroneously introduced in evidence, such error in the admission of the confession becomes harmless, and is not ground for reversal.</p> <p>3. TRIAL \u2014 Instructions\u2014Meaning of Terms, (a) Where the court instructs the jury that, if they convict a defendant of murder, they should assess his punishment at death or imprisonment in the penitentiary at hard labor for life, as in' their discretion they may see fit, the court should not attempt to define the legal meaning of the word \u2018 \u2018 discretion. \u201d</p> <p>4. HOMICIDE \u2014 Instructions \u2014 Self-Defense \u2014 Applicability to Evidence. (a) It is only in cases of homicide where the issue of self-defense is presented that it is necessary for the court to instruct the jury that they must view the facts and circumstances in evidence from the standpoint of the defendant as they reasonably appeared to him at the time of the homicide.</p> <p>(b) It is only when the testimony given by the defendant presents issues upon which he might be acquitted, or upon which the offense might be reduced to a lower degree, that he is entitled to have the jury instructed upon the hypothesis that such testimony is true.</p> <p>5.

The fundamental law embodies those principles, some in form of declaration, others by way of implied or express prohibition, and some in the form of grant, supposed to be limitations essential to conserve human liberty, security, equality, and happiness, and not to be subject to change except in a way calculated to arouse the highest judgment and most efficient deliberate considerate choice.</p> <p>2. Each of the three distinct departments of government, \u2014 executive, legislative, and judicial, \u2014 is supreme in its sphere; outside thereof is usurpatious, and that of the judiciary includes, power to dominate, efficiently, as regards marking the precise-boundaries of each and remedying invasions by either of the-territory of the other.</p> <p>3. The sole power to make law is lodged in the legislature with competency, however, to exercise it, by adopting an enactment, complete in itself, and prescribing the conditions under which it shall be vitalized, as by a vote of the people at large or those-of a particular district, according to circumstances.</p> <p>4. The power to grant municipal charters is an attribute of sovereignty, exercisable, anciently, solely by the personal sovereign, then by his legislative body by his consent. Here the-, people succeeded to that prerogative power and, by the fundamental law, made the legislature the repository thereof.</p> <p>5. The power to make, change, or repeal municipal charters was legislative in character by the common law in force when the? state was admitted into the Union and so expressly retained by sec. 13, art. XIV, in the general retention of our common-law system, as a whole, to remain in force till changed by the-le'gislature in the constitutional way.</p> <p>6. Power of the legislature to change the common law, in force in. this state when the constitution was adopted, is limited, respecting municipal charters, by sec. 1, art. XI, which, in form,, grants thereto power to form municipal corporations, which, by necessary implication, includes power to grant municipal charters, fixing all fundamentals with reference to the special city-government and prohibits exercise of such power otherwise, under the rule Expressio unius exclusio alterius.</p> <p>7. Sec. 32, art. IV, of the constitution commanding legislative provision for the transaction of any business, the doing of which' by special legislation is prohibited by sec. 31 of such article, contemplates a legislative effort, in general, such as by the enactment of a law to be passive until made active by a vote of the people of any district authorized to act on the question,\u2014 not delegation of power to the people at large or of districts, or a district, according to circumstances, to do the business.</p> <p>8. The idea embodied in sec. 31, art. IV, of the constitution, as to . city charters, is that they shall be uniform throughout the state, as near as practicable, which would be violated by affording cities capacity to create want of uniformity by the exercise of authority, in severalty, to make, change, and repeal their charters.</p> <p>9. The power, in form, delegated by ch. 476, Laws of 1911, by the language, \u201cEvery city, in addition to the power now possessed, is- hereby given authority to alter or amend its charter, or to adopt a new charter,\u201d is such dominating feature thereof as to render all others subsidiary thereto and dependable thereon.</p> <p>10. The power so, in form, delegated is one which was within the exclusive legislative field before the constitution and confined thereto thereby.</p> <p>11. The ruling feature of ch. 476, Laws of 1911, being unconstitutional, the others, forming an inseparable whole, take the cast thereof and fall therewith as invalid.</p> <p>[Syllabus by Marshall, J.]</p>"}

When in courts of concurrent jurisdiction, the pendency of a suit in one is relied on to defeat a second suit in the other, the identity cf the parties, of the case made, and of the relief sought, should be such that if the first suit had been decided it could be pleaded in bar as a former adjudication.</p> <p>2. In such cases, the proceedings in an appellate court are part of the proceedings in the first court, and orders made by it to be enforced by the court of primary jurisdiction are, while unexecuted, a part of the case in the first suit, which may be relied on as lis pendens in reference to the second suit.</p> <p>3. Hence an unexecuted order of this kind, made by a State court to restore possession to tho parties who hud been deprived of it by a decree which had been reversed, cannot be interfered with by another court by way of injunction, especially by a court of the United States, by reason of the act of Congress of March 2d, 1793. (1 Stat. at Large, 334, $ \u00a13.)</p> <p>4. But the nature and character of the possession so decreed to be delivered may be inquired into by another court, and if it was of a fiduciary character, and the trust was not involved in the first suit, a second suit may be sustained in any court of competent jurisdiction, to declare, define, and protect tbe trust, though the first suit may be still pending.</p> <p>5. Controversies in the civil courts concerning property rights of religious societies are generally to bo decided by a reference to one or more of three propositions:</p> <p>(1st.) Was the property or fund which is in question, devoted by the express terms of the gift, grant, or sale by which it was acquired, to the support of any specific religious doctrine or belief, or was it acquired for the general use of the society for religious purposes, with no other limitation?</p> <p>(2d.) Is the society which owned it of tbe strictly congregational or independent form of church government, owing no submission to any organization outside tbe congregation?</p> <p>(3d.) Or is it one of a number of such societies, united to form a more general body of churches, with ecclesiastical control in the general association over the members and societies of which it is composed?</p> <p>6. In the first class of cases the court will, when necessary to protect the trust to which the property has been devoted, inquire into the religious faith or practice of the parties claiming its use or control, and will see that it shall not be diverted from that trust.</p> <p>7. If the property was acquired in the ordinary way of purchaso or gift, for the use of a religious society, the court will inquire who constitute that society, or its legitimate successors, and award to them the use of the property.</p> <p>8. In case of the independent order of the congregation, this is to be determined by the majority of the society, or by such organization of the society, as by its own rules constitute its government.</p> <p>9. In the class of cases in which property has been acquired in the same way by a society which constitutes a subordinate part of a general religious organization with established tribunals for ecclesiastical government, theso tribunals must decide all questions of faith, discipline, rule, custom, or ecclesiastical government.</p> <p>10. In such cases where the right of property in the civil court is dependent on tbe question of doctrine, discipline, ecclesiastical law, rule, or custom, or church government, and that has been decided by the highest tribunal within the organization to which it has been carried, tbe civil court will accept that decision as conclusive, and be governed by it in its application to the case before it.</p> <p>11. The principles which induced a different rule in the English courts, examined and rejected as inapplicable to the relations of church and state in this country, and an examination of the American cases found to sustain the principle above stated.</p>"}
