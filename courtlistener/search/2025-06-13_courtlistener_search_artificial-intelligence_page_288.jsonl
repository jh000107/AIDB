{"absolute_url": "/opinion/3559352/musser-v-musser/", "attorney": "Carl G. Wagner, Frank T. Burnham, Frank W. Yale,  and  Ernest  S. Ellis,  for appellants.\n\n(1) The will, by its terms, refers to and provides that it shall be construed under the laws of the State of Kansas. This reference and provision makes the law of Kansas as much a part of the will as though it had been inserted  verbatim  therein. Shulsky v. Shulsky,  98 Kan. 69 ; Chambers v. McDaniel, 28 N.C. 229 ; Vestry v. Bostwick, 8 App. B.C. 456; 40 Cyc. 1094, notes. (2) The trust sought to be created by the will is not a public charity, and is void on its face, under the laws of the State of Kansas, as being against the rule prohibiting perpetuities of title in estates, because the fund provided can only be used for the benefit of certain persons to be selected and certified by the \"school board\" from a classification of individuals, which does not arise in the course of nature, but is wholly arbitrary and grows out of and only exists in the \"private conventions, class associations and artificial distinctions of men.\" Troutman v. DeBoissiere,  66 Kan. 1 . (3) The power to appoint and certify beneficiaries sought by said will to be conferred upon the\n\"school board\" cannot be exercised. Its powers are fixed by statute and it cannot be the recipient of or exercise any power sought to be conferred upon it by an individual. Hence, the intended beneficiaries of the trust cannot be legally ascertained and determined. Harwood v. Tracy,  118 Mo. 637 ; Dodson v. Scruggs, 47 Mo. 285 ; Re Hoffer's Estate,  70 Wis. 407 ; Leman v. Sherman, 117 Ill. 657 ; Sinking Fund Commrs. v. Walker, 6 How. (U.S.) 143; Shaw v. Payne, 12 Allen (Mass.) 293; Dunbar v. Soule, 129 Mass. 284 ; McClary v. McLain,  2 Ohio St. 368 ; English v. Sailors' Snug Harbor, 3 Pet. (U.S.) 99; 1 Perry on Trusts, sec. 296; 35 Cyc. 899 et seq.; 39 Cyc. 272, and notes; 28 Am.  Eng. Ency. (2 Ed.) 965; 12 Am.  Eng. Ency. 301. (4) But even if such power of appointment could be conferred upon the \"school board\" the provisions of the will are incomplete and insufficient to permit action thereunder, because no standard or measure of the required qualifications of beneficiaries is provided, and no means or method is named by which the facts necessary to be certified may be ascertained. In re Hauck,  70 Mich. 410 ; Fountaine v. Ravenel, 19 How. (U.S.) 368; Beckman v. Bonsor,  23 N.Y. 298 ; Grimes v. Harman,  35 Ind. 220 ; Gallego's v. Atty. Gen., 3 Leigh, 450; Dashiel v. Atty. Gen., 5 Har.  Johns. 392; Hughes v. Daly, 49 Conn. 34 ; Lepage v. McNamara,  5 Iowa 124 ; White v. Fisk, 22 Conn. 31 . (5) The trust attempted to be created by the will cannot be sustained as a public charity because the State and the public, through its courts, possess no \"admitted right of visitation and control.\" Troutman v. DeBoissiere,  66 Kan. 1 . On the contrary the will by its terms expressly precludes the courts from the exercise of such right and power.\n\n Dwight M. Smith  and  Goodwin Creason  for respondents.\n\n(1) The attack upon the will in question being predicated upon the laws of Kansas, and no laws of\nKansas that affect the validity of the will being pleaded, the amended petition of plaintiff below stated no cause of action, and demurrer was properly sustained. Gibson v. Railroad, 225 Mo. 485 ; Rialto Co. v. Minor,  183 Mo. App. 128 ; McDonald v. Life Assn.,  154 Mo. 628 ; Lee v. Mo. Pac.,  195 Mo. 415 ; Coleman v. Lucksinger,  224 Mo. 14 ; Ginnochio v. Railroad,  155 Mo. App. 168 ; State v. Harty, 208 S.W. (Mo.) 837. (2) Since plaintiff's amended petition alleges the common law to be in force in Kansas, and pleads no statute or decision of Kansas modifying it, a Missouri court in construing the will in question must presume the common law of Kansas to be the same as the common law of Missouri, as found in its own decisions. McPike v. McPike,  111 Mo. 226 ; Kollock v. Emmert  Co.,  43 Mo. App. 570 ; Jordan v. Pence, 123 Mo. App. 324 ; Morrissey v. Wiggins Ferry Co.,  47 Mo. 525 ; Bank v. Com. Co.,  139 Mo. App. 124 . (3) The will in question, under the laws of Missouri, creates a public charity of the most unimpeachable character. Crow ex rel. v. Clay County, 196 Mo. 261 ; Catron v. Scarritt Collegiate Institute,  264 Mo. 725 ; Robinson v. Crutcher, 209 S.W. (Mo.) 104; Strother v. Barrow, 246 Mo. 241 ; Sandusky v. Sandusky,  261 Mo. 357 ; Hadley v. Forsee, 203 Mo. 426 ; Buchanan v. Kennard,  234 Mo. 139 ; Buckley v. Monck, 187 S.W. (Mo.) 34; Cummings v. Dent, 189 S.W. (Mo.) 1161; Sappington v. School Fund Trustees,  123 Mo. 32 ; Anderson v. Roberts, 147 Mo. 486 ; Lackland v. Walker,  151 Mo. 257 ; Chambers v. St. Louis, 29 Mo. 543 ; Howe v. Wilson,  91 Mo. 45 ; Powell v. Hatch,  100 Mo. 592 ; Barkley v. Donnelly,  112 Mo. 561 ; Missouri Hist. Society v. Academy of Science,  94 Mo. 466 . (4) The will is equally valid under Kansas statutes and decisions, as well as general law relating to charitable trusts. Troutman v. DeBoissiere, 66 Kan. 1 ; Washburn College v. O'Hara,  75 Kan. 700 ; Keeler v. Lauer, 73 Kan. 393 ; Secs. 9850, 9840, 9841, 7443, 7445, Statutes of Kansas 1909; 5 R.C.L. 309; 11 C.J. p. 361, sec. 20. (5) Since the will creates a valid public charity,\nand provides competent trustees to take title, the heirs-at-law have no interest in the estate, and the plan provided in the will for designating beneficiaries does not concern them. W.C.A. v. Kansas City,  147 Mo. 103 ; Academy of Visitation v. Clemmens, 50 Mo. 167 ; Crow ex rel. v. Clay County,  196 Mo. 261 ; Sandusky v. Sandusky,  265 Mo. 234 ; Glaze v.
