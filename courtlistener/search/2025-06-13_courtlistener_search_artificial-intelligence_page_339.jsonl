The defendants, as officers and members of the district board of District No. 14, United Mine Workers of America, were about to call a strike of miners and mine workers in that district, which comprises the coal-producing counties of Kansas. The strike, if called, would prevent the carrying on of-business, commerce, occupations, and work in the state, would stop production, manufacture and transportation of necessaries of life, would inhibit domestic and household activities of the people, would affect the public peace and the public health, would cut off the supply of fuel for the state\u2019s educational, penal, charitable, and other institutions, and would otherwise inflict on the public irreparable injury, for which there was no redress. One object of the strike was to defeat the purposes of chapter 29 of the Laws of 1920, creating a tribunal known as the court of industrial relations, to regulate certain industries, including that of coal mining. In an action brought by the state, the defendants were enjoined from calling a 'strike. Afterwards they violated the injunction, were proceeded against for contempt of court for violating the injunction, and were found guilty, after a trial before the court, without a jury. The conduct of the defendants in calling the strike was punishable as a felony under the statute referred to. Held:</p> <p>1. The state was authorized to apply for, and the court was authorized to grant, the injunction, to avert threatened public calamities, irrespective of the state\u2019s ownership of property affected, and without the aid of a statute.</p> <p>2. The injunction order was not forbidden by section 7149 of the General Statutes of 1915, relating to granting injunctions in specified cases of industrial disputes.</p> <p>3. The injunction order was not invalid as an attempt to enjoin the commission of crime.</p> <p>4. The defendants were not entitled, in the contempt proceeding, to a trial by jury.</p> <p>5. The contempt proceeding was otherwise free from irregularity.</p> <p>6. The act creating the court of industrial relations is not void under the constitution of this state becausei of duality of subject, or defect of title, or because it commingles functions of separate departments of government, or because it attempts to enlarge the original jurisdiction of this court.</p> <p>/7. The business of producing coal in this state bears an intimate ^relation to the public peace, health, and welfare, is affected with a public interest, and may be regulated, to the end that reasonable continuity and efficiency of production may be maintained.</p> <p>8. The act creating the court of industrial relations is a reasonable and valid exercise of the police power of the state over the business of producing coal, and does not impair liberty of contract or permit involuntary servitude, contrary to the constitution of the United States.</p>"}
