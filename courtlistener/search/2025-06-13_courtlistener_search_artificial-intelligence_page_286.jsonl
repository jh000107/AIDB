Gilmer at the time of the said conveyance.\n\nThe defendants J. E. Gilmer, J. L. Gilmer and Powell Gilmer &#8212; the latter by their guardian J. E. Gilmer &#8212; filed their joint answer admitting the judgments recovered against the said J. E. Gilmer in favor of the plaintiffs, denying that the said conveyances were made for the purpose of hindering, delaying and defrauding the plaintiffs.\n\nThe defendant J. W. Shepherd, trustee, filed a separate answer admitting the execution of the trust deed to himself by the defendant J. E. Gilmer, and denying the allegations of fraud.\n\nBy leave of the court the plaintiffs filed an amendment to the complaint, setting out two additional causes of action, as follows:\n\nAs to the deed by Gilmer to Shepherd, trustee, the plaintiffs say:\n\n\"That the same in its terms and provisions is in conflict with the Act of 1893, regulating assignments and deeds of trust in that, under the provisions of said deed, the trustee is not required absolutely to close the trust within the next year after making the same, (687) but by the provisions thereof it may be continued indefinitely, and is therefore void.\n\n \"Twelfth:  That neither the defendant Gilmer, the grantor, nor Shepherd, trustee, the grantee, have complied with the terms and provisions of said act, in that among other things defendant Gilmer, the grantor, has not filed a sworn schedule of the preferred claims under said act as therein provided, nor Shepherd, trustee, a sworn inventory of the property which come into his hands under said deed.\n\n\"Wherefore the plaintiffs insist that said deed is void and of no effect.\"\n\nIssues were submitted to the jury, without objection, and answered by them as follows:\n\n1. Was the trust deed dated 18 January, 1894, executed by J. E. Gilmer with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud his creditors or any one of them? Answer, \"No.\"\n\n2. Was the deed dated 2 August, 1893, from J. E. Gilmer to his\nsons John L. and Powell Gilmer fraudulent and void? Answer, \"No.\"\n\n3. Was the said deed a voluntary conveyance as to all undivided 92-100 interest? Answer, \"No.\"\n\nAs to any remaining interest? Answer, \"Yes.\"\n\n4. Was the lot described in said deed purchased and the factory thereon constructed by J. E. Gilmer in whole or in part with funds borrowed by him from his wife with the understanding and agreement between them that the property should belong to their sons, the said John L. and Powell Gilmer? Answer, \"Yes.\"\n\n5. If so, what amount of money belonging to his said wife was thus used by said J. E. Gilmer? Answer, \"$9,200.\"\n\n6. Was the bill of sale of the stock of goods on 1 July, 1893, fraudulent and void? Answer, \"No.\"\n\n7. If there was such a trust deed as is mentioned in issue 4th was it a fraudulent trust? Answer, \"No.\"         (688)\n\nThe plaintiffs introduced in evidence a deed from the defendant to his sons John L. and Powell Gilmer, conveying what was known as \"the Factory Lot\" in Winston. The deed was dated 2 August, 1893, probated 4 August, 1893, and registered 5 January, 1894. The consideration was stated to be \"ten dollars and the further consideration of natural love and affection which he bears to his sons John L. Gilmer and Powell Gilmer and the further consideration of the large sum of money belonging to the mother of John L. Gilmer and Powell Gilmer and used by the grantor in the purchase of the lot herein conveyed and erecting the building thereon.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs also introduced a deed of trust from the defendant to J. W. Shepherd, dated and probated 18 January, 1894, and registered 22 January, 1894. The deed was made for the purpose of securing certain debts therein mentioned and contained a defeasance clause providing that if the grantor should fail to pay the debts secured by the deed on or before 2 April, 1894, then the trustee, upon application of any of the unpaid creditors, should sell the lands conveyed at auction and apply the proceeds to the payment of the said debts and costs, etc., and pay any surplus to the grantor.\n\nThe plaintiffs also introduced records of judgments against the defendant and others aggregating about $250,000, together with executions on those belonging to the plaintiffs on which the sheriff had returned \"nothing to be found.\"\n\nFor the defendants, the trustee J. W. Shepherd testified, among other things, that at request of creditors he had sold all the property conveyed in the deed in trust at public auction to the defendant John L. Gilmer for $25,000, with which he had been enabled to settle all the debts mentioned in the deed of trust; that he personally\n(689) knew of a good many of the secured debts and that they were   bona fide;  that he never had any reason to think that any of the debts were not  bona fide , and that no fraudulent suggestion was ever heard of by him.\n\nThe other material facts developed in the testimony appear in the plaintiffs' request for instructions and the charge of  Battle, J .\n\nThe allegations of fact contained in the amendment to the complaint were admitted by the defendants on the trial, without prejudice as to any conclusions of law therein stated.\n\nThe trial of this action commenced on Wednesday, 26 November, 1894, during the week of Special Term, which term would have ended with that week but for the judge continuing the term under the statute, Code, sec. 1228, as amended by Laws 1893, chap. 226, which the plaintiffs insisted that he had no right to do, and they duly excepted to this ruling that he did not have such right. The case was given to the jury on Saturday of that week at 7 p. m., and the court took a recess then for supper till 9 p. m., met again at that hour, and the jury having come in and announced that they could not agree, the judge ordered an adjournment of the court until Monday, 3 December, 1894, at 9 a. m., to which the plaintiffs objected as above stated. Court met on 3 December, 1894, at 9 a. m., pursuant to adjournment. The jury appeared and announced that they had not yet agreed, whereupon they were directed to retire and court was adjourned from time to time (as will appear from the entries in the minute docket, which will be copied and hereto annexed) until the judgment was signed.\n\nThe verdict was rendered on Tuesday, 4 December, and after that the special term was continued from day to day by consent of (690) parties in order that plaintiffs' counsel might prepare and present their motion for a new trial. The regular term of Forsyth Superior Court convened on Monday, 3 December, 1894, at 10 a. m., and continued for two weeks.\n\nWhen the jury came into court Monday morning, 3 December, at 9 a. m., and said they could not agree, the judge told them that it would be a lame and impotent conclusion of the special term, if four days' labor during that term was to go for nothing. \"It is important to the parties, it is important to the public that this litigation shall come to an end. You are intelligent men, and are just as able to decide these issues as any other jury will be.\n\n\"You ought to consult and reason together and come to a verdict. You ought not to be obstinate about the matter. It is your duty to agree if you possibly can. I shall be here holding court for two weeks, and you will have plenty of time to reflect on the matter.\"\n\nLate in the afternoon of the same day the jury again came into\ncourt and one of them had certain written questions which he asked the judge and he answered the same, and then said to the jury: \"You should reason together, gentlemen, and try to come to a unanimous conclusion on all the issues. I repeat to you what I said this morning, that we have been engaged in this trial for some time, and it is to the interest of the parties and of the public that the suit should come to an end. It is against the public interest that the docket should be in a crowded condition. It prevents persons whose rights are invaded from bringing suits, which they think will be so long in being tried. I do not mean that you should render a compromise verdict which would be improper. If one or two of you should think one way and the others another way (I do not know how you stand, I merely say this for an illustration), that one or those two should not be obstinate about the matter, but all should reason together, discuss the matter fully and see if they cannot arrive at unanimity.\" The jury then retired, remained out all night, and the next morning returned the   (691) verdict which appears in the record.\n\nAt the close of the testimony, the plaintiffs asked the court to hold as a matter of law:\n\n1. That the deed of trust executed by J. E. Gilmer to the defendant Shepherd was void upon its face as being in conflict with and inconsistent with chapter 453, Laws 1893, regulating deeds of assignment as is alleged in the amendment to the plaintiffs' complaint and numbered No. 11, and\n\n2. The plaintiffs asked the court to hold the deeds of trust from Gilmer to Shepherd as void, for the reason that it was admitted that neither the grantor Gilmer nor the trustee Shepherd had complied with the terms and provisions of the said Act of 1893 regulating assignments and deeds of trust, in that, among other things, the defendant Gilmer, the grantor, had not filed a sworn schedule of the preferred claims under said act as therein provided, nor the said trustee, Shepherd, a sworn inventory of the property which came into his hands under said deed. The court reserved these questions until after the verdict of the jury, and then refused to grant the motions of the plaintiffs, to which the plaintiffs excepted.\n\nAt the close of the testimony plaintiffs submitted prayers for instructions as follows:\n\n1. That taking all the evidence as true with regard to the conveyance of factory, the deed from Gilmer to his sons is a voluntary conveyance and void as to the plaintiffs.\n\n2. That it appears by uncontradicted evidence that the sale of the goods was:\n\n(1) When plaintiff had a subsisting debt.\n\n(692)    (2) Was to a son of the debtor Gilmer.\n\n(3) Was on 6, 12, 18 and 24 months time.\n\n(4) Son was at the time of sale of goods not worth more than $500.\n\n(5) Immediately after sale of goods the purchaser issued bill heads, stating that the purchasing firm consisted of W. H. Marler and the two sons, one of whom was at the time nineteen years of age.\n\n(6) No security was taken by the debtor but simply the unsecured notes of the son.\n\n(7) That at the time of sale the debtor, Gilmer, was greatly embarrassed.\n\n(8) That this embarrassment existing in July, 1893, resulted in insolvency.\n\nThat these facts being established, the law declares the sale void as to plaintiffs unless evidence of other and additional facts indicating good faith is furnished by defendant, and such additional evidence as appears in this case is not sufficient in law to show good faith in the transaction, and the jury must find the sale of goods to be void as to the plaintiffs.\n\n3. That if the deed of trust to Shepherd was made by defendant Gilmer with the intent to hinder, delay and defraud his creditors, or any of them, the same is void, although neither the trustee, Shepherd, nor the beneficiaries thereunder knew of or participated in such fraudulent intentions and although the debts secured thereby are  bona fide .\n\n4. As to the deeds to the sons, the court is asked to charge the jury that the request of Mrs. Gilmer that defendant J. E. Gilmer should buy the lot and build the factory with money owing to her and represented by notes of defendant Gilmer, and convey the same to her sons John L. and Powell Gilmer, and defendant's verbal promise to do so, was a mere executory, oral contract, and not (693) being carried into effect in wife's lifetime the same was incapable of enforcement in specie by the courts, and the notes to the wife, by her death, intestate, became the property of J. E. Gilmer, and therefore it was incompetent and inadmissible in defendant J. E. Gilmer when the money represented by his notes had become his absolute property, to fall back on the incomplete purposes of himself and wife in regard to the factory, and thus execute a deed to the boys; and as to this property, to wit, the factory, the deed of Gilmer to his sons is not founded on valuable consideration and is therefore void as to his creditors.\n\n5. If the court refuses to instruct that upon the case made the deed from Gilmer to his sons was a voluntary conveyance and shall\nleave it to the jury to say whether there was a trust, which existed at the death of Mrs. Gilmer, in favor of her sons, which he could execute by conveying to them, then plaintiffs request the court to hold and charge that upon all the evidence the trust was secret and therefore void as to plaintiffs &#8212; Refused; but the court told the jury that if it was a secret, fraudulent trust, the husband to hold himself out as owner, to sail under false colors, if such was the purpose of the parties to the trust, then the same is void and no trust at all, and the seventh issue should be answered \"Yes.\"\n\n6. If the debt of $2,000 preferred in the trust deed to John and Powell, consisted of rents and sales of timber from lands belonging to Lettie with a remainder over to John and Powell, the rents and sales accruing in the lifetime of Lettie, and in the hands of J. E. Gilmer, as guardian, at her death, the money thus due to her became the property of J. E. Gilmer on her death, and did not belong to John and Powell, and hence the preference was fictitious and the insertion of a fictitious debt in this trust deed is a fraud on the part of the grantor, and therefore vitiates the deed, and the first issue   (694) must be answered \"Yes.\"\n\n7. If the debt of $2,000 preferred in the trust deed to John and Powell, consisted of rents and sales of timber from land belonging to Lettie, with a remainder over to John and Powell, the rents and sales accruing in the lifetime of Lettie, and in the hands of J. E. Gilmer, as guardian, at her death, the money thus due to her became the property of J. E. Gilmer on her death, and did not belong to John and Powell, and hence the preference was fictitious and the insertion of a fictitious debt in this trust deed is a strong badge and circumstance of fraud.\n\n8. There is evidence that some of the debts secured by the trust deeds were debts in which the debtor, J. E. Gilmer, was liable jointly and severally with others who were solvent and responsible and that these debts were described in the trust deed as being the debts of J. E. Gilmer, without reciting the fact of the liability of these other debtors; and there is evidence that some of said debts recited in the trust deed were secured by good and valuable collaterals, which were not recited in the trust deed. If J. E. Gilmer had the purpose in making the trust deed to suppress these facts and thereby magnify his indebtedness and mislead his creditors, this amounts to an intent to hinder, delay and defraud his creditors, and makes the deed void and the jury must answer the first issue \"Yes.\"\n\n9. If the jury should find that Gilmer inserted in the deed to Shepherd the debt of $4,000 as due to Gilmer, Marler  Co., at a time when they, as a firm, were indebted to him in a greater sum with the\npurpose thereby to magnify his indebtedness and mislead his creditors, this amounts to an intent to hinder, delay and defraud his creditors, and such intent vitiates the deed and you will answer \"Yes\" to the first issue.\n\nThe court declined to give instruction No. 1.\n\nThe court refused to give instruction No. 2, as therein set (695) out, but in lieu thereof gave instructions as hereinafter set out.\n\nThe court gave instruction No. 3.\n\nThe court refused instruction No. 4, but instructed the jury on that point as hereinafter appears.\n\nIn regard to the plaintiffs' 6th prayer for instructions, the judge struck out the last part thereof, beginning with the words, \"hence the preference was fictitious,\" and inserted in lieu thereof, \"if the defendant, J. E. Gilmer, knew this and fraudulently inserted this debt in the trust deed, that would vitiate the whole trust deed, and the first issue should then be answered \"Yes\"; but this would not be so if the inserting of a debt that he did not really owe was due to an honest mistake.\"\n\nA similar change was made by the judge in the 7th prayer for instructions.\n\nThese prayers for instructions, thus changed, were given to the jury.\n\nThe judge recapitulated the evidence, applied the law thereto, and instructed the jury fully in these and all other law points raised. He was not requested to put his charge in writing. Among other instructions he gave the following:\n\n\"1. The defendants' counsel contend that the relation of debtor and creditor existing between J. E. Gilmer and his wife, he owing her $9,200, there was an agreement between him and her that he would purchase a lot in Winston and build thereon a tobacco factory, the property so acquired to be held in trust for her two sons, John and Powell, he, the said J. E. Gilmer, to use in the acquiring of such property the money that he owed her as far as it would go, or his own money with the understanding that the money thus expended (696) should go as credit on her notes against him, and that, in pursuance of this agreement, he, joining in with one Edmunds, purchased a lot in Winston from W. A. Whitaker and built a factory thereon, paying for the lot and building about $17,000, and afterwards in pursuance of the same agreement took a deed 26 May, 1891, from said Edmunds for his interest in said property; and that the amount of her money used in this way was $9,200, the cost of the property then being $17,000.\n\n\"If the jury believe that the facts are as above stated then the two\nsons became as soon as the property was acquired the equitable owners of 92-170 thereof and as to such undivided interest the deed from said J. E. Gilmer to said John L. Gilmer and Powell Gilmer, dated 2 Aug., 1893, is not voluntary.\n\n\"The alleged facts on which this alleged trust depends must be proven by the defendants to the satisfaction of the jury by evidence which, in their judgment, is cogent, clear, strong and convincing. If the jury do not consider such facts so proven, then they will answer the 3d issue: Yes. If they do not consider such facts so proven, they will answer said issue: No, as to an undivided 92-170 interest. Yes, as to the remaining interest.\n\n\"If the lot was purchased and the factory built without any such agreement as above mentioned, or without the existence of facts necessary to create a trust as aforesaid, then the notes held by the wife against the husband, remaining unpaid at her death (she dying intestate), became the property of the husband as her sole distributee (he becoming, that is, the real owner thereof, subject to the claims of her creditors, if any); and the third issue must in that case be answered, Yes.\n\n\"4. In a case of circumstantial evidence, there are two inquiries for the jury: (a) The evidential facts, that is, the facts relevant to the issue &#8212; are they true? (b) Do you infer from such      (697) facts that the fact in issue exists? For example in regard to the sixth issue, the fact in issue (alleged by plaintiffs and denied by the defendants) is, that the goods were sold 1 July, 1893, by J. E. Gilmer to John L. Gilmer with intent to defeat, or to hinder, or to delay the creditors of J. E. Gilmer or some one or more of them; or putting this in other words that his purpose, or some part of his purpose, in making this sale, was to promote his own ease and favor, at the expense of, or to the prejudice of the rights of his creditors.\"\n\nThe evidential facts on which the plaintiffs rely and which the defendants do not contradict, are the following:\n\n(a) That the plaintiffs had at the time subsisting debts.\n\n(b) That the said purchaser was the near relative, the son, of the seller of the goods.\n\n(c) That the sale was not for cash, but on time, notes being taken payable in 6, 12, 18 and 24 months.\n\n(d) That no security was taken for said notes.\n\n(e) That the purchaser was not worth more than $5,000.\n\n(f) That at the time of sale debtor, J. E. Gilmer, was greatly embarrassed.\n\n(g) That immediately after sale the purchasers issued bill heads\nstating that the purchasing firm consisted of W. H. Marler and two sons, one of whom was at the time nineteen years of age.\n\n(h) That the debtor J. E. Gilmer's financial embarrassment, existing in July, 1893, resulted in insolvency.\n\nThe question is whether, from these facts and other evidential facts which you may find to exist, you infer the existence of the fact in issue.\n\nThe defendants argue against such an inference and contend (698) that they have proven the following evidential facts:\n\n\"1. That the said J. E. Gilmer's purpose in selling the goods was to get out of business on account of the ill health of himself and other members of his family, etc.\n\n\"2. That he has reason to believe that the notes taken for his son would be paid &#8212; his wife, who had considerable property, having frequently expressed to him her desire and purpose to set her said son up in business.\n\n\"3. That the said son was of good business qualifications, sober and industrious.\n\n\"4. That the printing of Powell Gilmer's name on the bill heads was a mistake. He hadn't really been taken into the firm of Gilmer, Marler  Co., as a member, but it was only intended that he should become a member when he attained his majority. The question is whether these facts are true, and then whether from the whole evidence you infer the existence or non-existence of the fact in issue, remembering that on the whole case the burden of proof is on the plaintiffs.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs duly excepted to the refusal of the court to grant the first instructions prayed for &#8212; the refusal to give second instruction prayed for &#8212; and as prayed for, and to the giving of the instructions that were given in lieu thereof.\n\nSame as above in regard to the plaintiffs' 4th prayer &#8212; to the refusal to give their 5th prayer for instructions and to the instructions that were given in that connection. And to the changes that were made by the court in their 6th and 7th prayers. The plaintiffs further excepted to that portion of the judge's charge in which after recapitulating the evidential facts on which the plaintiffs relied, letters from \"a\" to \"h\" both inclusive, as to which the defendant had introduced no contradictory evidence, and after recapitulating the evidential facts (699) which the defendants claimed to exist in their favor, the judge refused to tell the jury that there was a legal presumption of fraud, but told the jury, \"The question is whether these facts are true and then from the whole evidence do you infer the existence or non-existence of the fact in issue, remembering that in the whole case the burden of proof is on the plaintiffs.\"\n\nThe jury responded to the issues as set out above. Plaintiffs moved\nfor a new trial, which was refused, and appealed from the judgment rendered. Errors assigned were as follows:\n\n\"First. That the court erred in refusing to grant the motion of the plaintiffs asking that the said deed of trust from Gilmer to Shepherd be declared void on its face as being inconsistent with the Act of 1893 regulating assignments and deeds of trust.\n\n\"Second. That the court erred in refusing to grant the motion of the plaintiffs asking that the deed of trust from Gilmer to Shepherd be declared void upon the admitted facts that neither the grantor, Gilmer, nor the grantee, Shepherd, had complied with the Act of 1893 in reference to assignments and deeds of trust.\n\n\"Third. That the court erred in ordering the jury to be brought into court and addressing them in the language as set out above.\n\n\"Fourth. That the court erred in continuing the special term after the regular term had been opened and receiving the verdict of the jury on Tuesday, 4 December, 1894, it being the second day of the regular term of the Forsyth Superior Court.\n\n\"Fifth. That the court erred in refusing to grant the special instructions numbered 1, 2 and 4 asked for by the plaintiffs, and in changing their 6th and 7th prayers for instructions.   (700)\n\n\"Sixth. That the court erred in giving in place of instructions fifth asked for, the following: `But if it was a secret fraudulent trust, husband to hold himself as owner, to sail under false colors, if such was the purpose of parties to trust, same is void as to plaintiffs, and no trust at all, and the seventh issue should be answered, Yes.'\n\n\"Seventh. That the court erred in charging the jury as follows: `After recapitulating the several facts on which the plaintiffs relied, and which the defendants did not contradict, and lettered respectively from \"a\" to \"h,\" both inclusive, and after recapitulating the evidential facts which the defendant J. E. Gilmer claims to have proven, the question is whether these facts are true, and then whether from the whole evidence you infer the existence or non-existence of the fact in issue, remembering that on the whole case the burden of the proof is on the plaintiffs.'\"", "procedural_history": "", "scdb_id": "", "sibling_ids": [3660776], "source": "Z", "status": "Published", "suitNature": "", "syllabus": ""}
