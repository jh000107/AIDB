Nos. 184, 186, and 189, the parties dispute whether the defendants should be compelled to produce the passenger name record (\"PNR\") codes associated with Ryanair flights purchased using the defendants' platforms. The court will grant the request to compel production of the PNR codes.

Those two employees may use the PNR codes only to determine whether and to what extent Ryanair suffered technical losses as a result of the defendants' actions.
