For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part, while Chen's motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(2) is DENIED. In particular, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs plausibly allege that Defendants made materially misleading statements in the Offering Materials about GigaCloud's use of AI in violation of Section 11 of the Securities Act. It follows that Plaintiffs' Section 15 claims relating to these statements also survive. By contrast, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim based on GigaCloud's marketplace activities. It follows that Plaintiffs' claims relating to these statements - under Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5 must be and are dismissed. The only remaining question is whether Plaintiffs should be permitted to replead their claims to the extent they have been dismissed as Plaintiffs request in passing. See Pls.' Mem. 25. Although leave to amend should be freely given when justice so requires, Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2), it is \"within the sound discretion of the district court to grant or deny leave to amend, Broidy Cap. Mgmt. LLC v. Benomar, 944 F.3d 436, 447 (2d Cir. 2019). Here, the problems with Plaintiffs dismissed claims are substantive, so amendment would be futile. See, e.g., Roundtree v. NYC, No. 19-CV-2475 (JMF), 2021 WL 1667193, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 28, 2021) (citing cases). Nor do Plaintiffs suggest that they are in possession of facts that would cure the problems with their dismissed claims. See, e.g., Clark v. Kitt, No. 12-CV-8061 (CS), 2014 WL 4054284, at *15 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 15, 2014) (\"A plaintiff need not be given leave to amend if [it] fails to specify how amendment would cure the pleading deficiencies in [its] complaint.\"); accord TechnoMarine SA v. Giftports, Inc., 758 F.3d 493, 505-06 (2d Cir. 2014). Finally, the Court granted Plaintiffs leave to amend in response to Defendants first motion to dismiss and explicitly warned that they would not be given any further opportunity to amend the complaint to address issues raised by the motion to dismiss. ECF No. 85. \"Plaintiffs failure to fix deficiencies in its previous pleadings is alone sufficient ground to deny leave to amend sua sponte.\" Transeo S.A.R.L. v. Bessemer Venture Partners VI L.P., 936 F. Supp. 2d 376, 415 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (citing cases)). Accordingly, Plaintiffs' request for leave to amend is DENIED. Unless and until the Court orders otherwise, Defendants shall file their Answer to Plaintiffs' surviving claims within three weeks of the date of this Opinion and Order. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(a)(4)(A). In addition, the initial pretrial conference, previously adjourned, is hereby reinstated and RESCHEDULED for March 26, 2025, at 9:00 a.m. To access the conference, counsel should call the Court's new dedicated conference call line at (855) 244-8681, and use access code 2303 019 3884, followed by the pound (#) key. When prompted for an attendee ID number, press the pound (#) key again. (Members of the press and public may call the same number, but will not be permitted to speak during the conference.) The parties are reminded to follow the procedures for telephone conferences described in the Court's Individual Rules and Practices for Civil Cases, which are available at https://nysd.uscourts.gov/hon-jessem-furman, including Rule 3(B)(i), which requires the parties, no later than 24 hours before the conference, to send a joint email to the Court with the names and honorifics (e.g., Mr., Ms., Dr., etc.) of counsel who may speak during the teleconference and the telephone numbers from which counsel expect to join the call. The parties are reminded that, no later than the Thursday before the initial pretrial conference, they must submit a joint status letter and proposed Case Management Plan. See ECF No. 53. The Clerk of Court is directed to terminate ECF Nos. 95 and 105. SO ORDERED. ( Initial Conference set for 3/26/2025 at 09:00 AM before Judge Jesse M. Furman.) (Signed by Judge Jesse M.
