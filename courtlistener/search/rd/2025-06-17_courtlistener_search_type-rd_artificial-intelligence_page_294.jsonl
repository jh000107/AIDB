{"absolute_url": "/docket/64917296/231/flynn-v-verizon-wireless/", "attachment_number": null, "cites": [112931, 789752, 1192479, 8411968], "description": "ORDER OF DISMISSAL. For the reasons stated in the attached ruling, the Court GRANTS the defendants' motions to dismiss (Docs. # 79, # 81, # 86, # 113 ), and otherwise dismisses any remaining claims against any remaining defendants under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). But because a court should ordinarily allow a pro se plaintiff at least one opportunity to file an amended complaint and because Flynn has already sought leave to do so, this dismissal is without prejudice to Flynn's filing of an amended complaint on or before September 1, 2023 if he has good faith grounds to file an amended complaint that overcomes the concerns stated in this ruling. The Court sets forth the following guidelines concerning the filing of any amended complaint:1. Any amended complaint must clearly identify the names of each plaintiff and each defendant in the caption of the complaint and must set forth facts to plausibly show how each named defendant has engaged in conduct that has proximately caused a concrete and particularized actual or imminent injury to each plaintiff.2. Any amended complaint should enumerate each distinct claim or cause of action and the particular source or provision of state or federal law that was violated. To the extent that the amended complaint may cite or refer in passing to any particular provision of the law, the Court will not assume that the complaint seeks to allege a cause of action under this law unless the complaint includes an enumerated claim that cites this law. For each claim or cause of action, the complaint should identify which defendants the plaintiff or plaintiffs seek to hold liable.3. Any amended complaint should take into concern the arguments raised in the defendants' motions to dismiss including but not limited to the arguments of the defendants concerning the proper identification of their names, concerning adequacy of service of process, and concerning preemption of state law claims by federal law. See Kaspers v. Verizon Wireless Servs., LLC, 2021 WL 2193992, at *2-4 (state law claims challenging 5G network preempted by the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996), recon. denied, 2021 WL 2193584, at *2-3 (N.D. Ga. 2021).4. Any amended complaint shall be filed once. The docket reflects that Flynn has engaged in serial filing of proposed amended complaints. If Flynn chooses to file an amended complaint, the Court will allow him a single opportunity to do so and will treat the first-filed amended complaint as the operative amended complaint in this action. Therefore, Flynn should carefully draft a single complaint for filing rather than loading the docket with serial versions of amended complaints.5. If more than one plaintiff wishes to join Flynn in this action, any such plaintiff must personally sign the amended complaint, and the amended complaint must include allegations to substantiate each plaintiff's standing and right to relief as to each defendant. The Clerk of Court shall close this case subject to automatic re-opening in the event that Flynn chooses to timely file an amended complaint. If Flynn chooses to file an amended complaint, then any named defendant may file any answer or other response to the filing of the amended complaint within 30 days of its filing, and the Court may also conduct a further review of the adequacy of the complaints allegations pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). It is so ordered. Signed by Judge Jeffrey A. Meyer on 8/10/2023. (Wang, S.)
