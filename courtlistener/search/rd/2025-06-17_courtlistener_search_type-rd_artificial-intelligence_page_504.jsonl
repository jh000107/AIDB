However, Nuance was sufficiently aware of the significant possibility that IBM was breaching the agreement prior to June 30, 2014 (i.e., more than two years before Nuance filed suit). Given what Nuance knew at the time, Nuance avoided making the appropriate inquiry to IBM and was willfully blind. Given Nuance's willful blindness, the Court further concludes that Nuance had actual knowledge that IBM was breaching the agreement prior to June 30, 2014. Under these circumstances, Nuance's claims are barred by the contractual limitations period. Accordingly, judgment shall be entered by separate document in favor of IBM and against Nuance.
