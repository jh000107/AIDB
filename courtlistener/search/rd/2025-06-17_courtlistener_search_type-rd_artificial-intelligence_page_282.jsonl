David Weisman: Magistrate initial status hearing held. Court noted inadvertently answering phone call from defense counsel regarding delaying hearing; Court confirms no substantive matters were discussed. Motion to dismiss remains pending. Protective order and 502(d) orders have been entered by District Court. ESI issue remains pending. Plaintiffs state that regardless of outcome of motion to dismiss, discovery will need to go forward on failure-to-warn claim. Defendant states bellwether protocol is being discussed between parties. Both parties indicate they have been conferring on search terms. As to custodians, defendant provided list of 70 custodians (35 employees and 35 patient advocates) to plaintiffs. Defendant states no ESI date ranges have been agreed upon. Plaintiffs are uncertain as to whether they will seek discovery from Roche (original manufacturer). Plaintiffs propose agreement upfront regarding ESI, including search terms and parameters of scope of ESI. Defendant states it will agree at this time that it will not use TAR or artificial intelligence in review process. Defendant agrees that ESI agreement for objective criteria is acceptable, but defendant objects to plaintiffs' proposed protocol, which defendant asserts implicates accountability and privilege issues. Both parties have submitted their version of an ESI protocol (defendant's at ECF 34, plaintiffs' at ECF 32 ), but parties disagree as to what they contain. Plaintiffs indicate they are willing to discuss and compromise regarding ESI protocol, acknowledging that they are giving up the burden placed on defendant by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to search all possible sources of the requested information. Defendant is open to ESI protocol as opposed to moving forward with discovery under Rule 34. Court inquired whether bellwether protocol would impact discovery. Plaintiffs addressed proposed bellwether points on which the parties agree, including twelve bellwether cases. Plaintiffs believe discovery should proceed as soon as possible. Defendant to submit original BLA and supplemental BLA regarding hearing loss to plaintiffs by 10/27/23, and then parties can discuss search terms and ESI production generally. Plaintiffs state all iterations of the supplemental BLAs should be produced; defendant states that is not what the District Court ordered. Defendants to produce all cover sheets/executive summaries (Form 4680) of all BLA supplements by 11/3/23. The parties agree that off-the-record ESI discovery-management conference, including discussion of agreed protocol, would be fruitful. Defendant is in process of gathering ESI search-term results (i.e. \"hit lists\"). Parties directed to meet and confer and conduct preliminary runs of search terms based on proposed search terms. Parties to submit joint report on 11/17/23 by 5 p.m. addressing whether parties want an on-the-record discovery hearing or off-the-record discovery management conference; a narrative from each side regarding status of discussions on ESI search terms and protocols, hit reports, and any proposed modification of search terms based on hit reports, among other issues the parties wish to raise. In-person discovery hearing set for 12/4/23 at 10:00 a.m. Bellwether discovery to be addressed initially with District Court.
