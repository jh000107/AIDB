Harjani: According to the status report 76, the parties currently dispute the nature of their agreed Phase I discovery. The Court heard argument on this matter and asked numerous questions. The Court has broad discretion in managing discovery and phasing it in a way that meets the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 1. Having reviewed the Amended Complaint 23 and the memorandum opinion 52 on the motion to dismiss, the Court issues the following order: Phase I discovery shall be limited to algorithmic decision-making tools employed by State Farm to screen out potentially fraudulent or complex claims from straightforward homeowners insurance claims. This is the gravamen of Plaintiff's amended complaint (see 23 paragraph 4). To be clear, the Phase I discovery proposed by Plaintiff is overbroad; it goes beyond the allegations of the Complaint. The Phase I discovery proposed by Defendant is too narrow: it is too limited to \"machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence tools\" that may not capture all \"algorithmic decision-making tools\" employed by State Farm to screen out potentially fraudulent or complex claims from straightforward claims. The Phase I discovery here lies somewhere between these two extremes. No further definition, in this Court's view, is necessary. Having said that, as became clear during the argument, Plaintiff does not know if any of these tools actually exist, and the Court does not know either; State Farm did not seem entirely sure. Thus, Phase I should start with a focus on what algorithmic tools are used at the outset to sort potentially fraudulent/complex claims from straightforward claims, before the parties start exploring such voluminous ESI discovery around communications and documents about their use, and the means and methods in which they are used that could, allegedly, result in a disparate impact. The parties shall meet and confer as a result of this order and propose a discovery schedule for Phase I that includes a preliminary focus on the identification of these tools. This should include some initial answers to interrogatories, some initial production of documents, and potentially a short Rule 30(b)(6) deposition all done expeditiously. The parties should identify the tools first through these discovery devices before the deep dive into the tools. Class-wide claims data and statistical data will be reserved for Phase Two. Joint status report on these matters is due by 3/1/24 and status hearing set for 3/6/2024 at 9:15 a.m. via video conference.
