By order dated September 11, 2012, the Hon. Dora L. Irizarry, United States District Judge, referred the class certification motions to me for a report and recommendation. After full briefing, I heard oral argument on October 11, 2012. Thereafter, the parties submitted supplemental materials. For the reasons stated in the attached Report & Recommendation, I respectfully recommend that the New York and California classes be certified as injunctive classes under FED. R. CIV. P. 23(b)(2), to litigate all aspects of plaintiffs' claims for declaratory and injunctive relief, and that plaintiffs' motions for class certification be denied in all other respects. Any objections to this Report and Recommendation must be filed with the Clerk of the Court, with courtesy copies to Judge Irizarry and to my chambers, within fourteen (14) days. Failure to file objections within the specified time waives the right to appeal the district court's order. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1) (2011); Fed. R. Civ. P. 72, 6(a), (e).
