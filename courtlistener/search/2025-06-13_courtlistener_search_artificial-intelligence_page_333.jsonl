Although there may he a defect of power in a corporation to make a contract, yet if a contract made by it is not in violation of its charter, or of any statute prohibiting it, and the corporation has by its promise induced a party relying on the promise and in execution of the contract, to expend money and perform his part thereof, the corporation will be liable on the contract.</p> <p>2. Same\u2014application of the rule\u2014former decision. This doctrine was applied in its full extent in the case of Bradley v. Ballard, 55 111. 413, though that being the case of a private corporation, it was there said there might be a difference with respect to municipal corporations, and that their debts illegally contracted by their officers would not be binding upon tax-payers.</p> <p>3. However, where the contract of a municipal corporation has no element of illegality, the objection made to it only alleging a defect of power in respect to the term of its duration, the doctrine that where a corporation has received benefits under a contract which is merely ultra vires, it shall pay for those benefits, should apply to the municipal corporation with equal force as in any case of a private corporation.</p> <p>4. Same\u2014of a contract by the diy of East St. Louis to light Us streets with gas. The city of East St. Louis entered into a contract with a private corporation which was organized for the purpose of the manufacture of gas, for the lighting of the streets of the city for a period of thirty years. In pursuance of the terms of the contract, the gas company extended its main pipes and erected lamp-posts from time to time, as provided by ordinances of the city, and for several years, without objection on the part of the city, furnished gas for the lighting of the streets. In a suit by the gas company against the city to recover for gas previously furnished under the contract, it was objected on the part of the city that the contract was ultra vires,\u2014that its term of duration was such as to operate as an improper abridgment of the legislative or governmental power of the city over the subject, and therefore the contract was not binding on the city, and there could, be no recovery. Without determining whether the contract, could be upheld in that respect, it was held, that as the objection did not question the legality of the contract, but only alleged a defect of power as to the period of its duration, it would apply only to the executory part of the contract, not to that part which had been executed. So the city was liable for the gas which had been furnished to it prior to the bringing of the suit.</p> <p>5. Same\u2014of the power to contract generally. By its charter, the city of East St. Louis was given power to contract and to be contracted with, to sue and to be sued, etc. It was also given power to provide for lighting the streets of the city;\u2014and to make all ordinances necessary to carry into effect the powers vested by the charter in the city. A private corporation created by the legislature of this State, was also given power to contract and be contracted with, and to manufacture and sell gas for lighting the streets of the city of East St. Louis, and was given the exclusive privilege of supplying the city with gas for a period of thirty years. It was held, not only had the city the general power to make a contract in the execution of the authority given it to provide for lighting its streets, but the contracting with this particular private corporation was given sufficient sanction by the express provisions of its charter on that subject.</p> <p>6. Same\u2014constitutional limitation as to creating indebtedness. Where a city entered into a contract for lighting its streets for a term of thirty years, the agreed price therefor to be paid monthly, which sum for any one year was not in excess of the limitation in seo. 12, of art. 9, of the constitution, but, taken for the whole term, was in excess of the debt it was authorized to incur, it was held, that the contract was not prohibited by the constitutional provision, but was legal and binding, there being created no present indebtedness for the whole sum, but only as the gas should be supplied from month to month.</p>"}

Laws, c. 189, authorizing the organization of boulevard corporations and the construction by them of boulevards, does not violate Const, art. 9, \u00a7 1, prohibiting the creation of corporations by special law, nor article 2, \u00a7 19, prohibiting special laws relating to the laying out, opening, etc., of highways, since such act is not a special but a general law, authorizing any five persons to form a boulevard corporation, and relating to a class of cor- , porations which by reason of the difference between boulevards and ordinary highways is not an arbitrary or unreal class.</p> <p>9. Statutes\u2014General and Special Laws.</p> <p>That a statute framed in general terms, authorizing the organization of a class of corporations, was passed at the instance and request of an individual, who gave the Legislature assurance that he would organize such a corporation, does not render it a special law.</p> <p>10. Statutes\u2014General and Special Laws\u2014\u201cGeneral Law\u201d.</p> <p>A law having a uniform operation as to all persons uniformly situated is a \"general law,\u201d and not a special law.</p> <p>11. Statutes\u2014Special Laws\u2014Classification of Subjects.</p> <p>To render the classification of subjects of legislation valid, it must not be arbitrary or unreasonable, but must be a real classification, resting upon some difference bearing a reasonable and just relation to the act in respect to which the classification is proposed.</p> <p>12. Eminent Domain\u2014Public Use\u2014What Constitutes.</p> <p>Land taken by eminent domain under the authority of 26 Del. Laws, c. 189, for the construction of a boulevard on which a highway for vehicles, a railway, and other public utilities are to be built, and the land beautified by-means of trees, walks, etc., is taken for a public purpose; and hence that act does not violate Const, art. 1, \u00a7 8, providing that no man\u2019s property shall be taken or applied to a public use without the consent of his representatives, and without compensation being made.</p> <p>13. Eminent Domain\u2014Delegation of Power\u2014Construction of Legislative Acts.</p> <p>The provisions of 26 Del. Laws, c. 189, authorizing boulevard corporations to use that portion of a strip of land acquired under that act for a boulevard, not devoted to a road for vehicles, for any other lawful purpose, only authorizes its use for other public purposes, and not for private purposes.</p> <p>14. Eminent Domain\u2014Delegation of Power\u2014Construction of Legislative Acts.</p> <p>26 Del. Laws, c. 189, authorizes boulevard corporations to acquire by condemnation a strip of land, part to be used as a highway and part for other public utilities, such as railways, telegraphs, etc. It also authorizes state officials to determine the location of the boulevard, and provides that the part to be used for vehicles shall be conveyed to the state. Held, that the statute clearly indicates an intention that the boulevard and all its elements shall be for the use and accommodation of the public, and a boulevard corporation, by accepting and exercising the right of eminent domain, imposes the obligation on it of devoting such strip of land to public purposes; and hence such act is not invalid, as not providing that the public shall have the use of such strip.</p> <p>15. Eminent Domain\u2014Determination of Validity of Exercise-Jurisdiction of Courts.</p> <p>26 Del. Laws, c. 189, authorizing boulevard corporations to acquire a strip of land for boulevards two hundred feet wide, is not invalid as authorizing the acquisition of more property than is reasonably necessary for the proper and legitimate purposes of a boulevard; the necessity for the exercise of the power of eminent domain and the quantity of land necessary being a question for legislative determination, not reviewable by the courts, unless possibly where there has been a gross abuse of legislative discretion or manifest fraud.</p> <p>16. Eminent Domain\u2014Exercise of Delegated Power.</p> <p>26 Del. Laws, c. 189, authorizes boulevard corporations to acquire land \u2022by condemnation for a boulevard, part to be used'as a road for vehicles and part for other public utilities. Section 168 exempts from taxation the land acquired, so long as not devoted to any of the utilities mentioned, and permits its exemption to extend for fifty years. Section 158 authorizes the corporation at any time to construct a railway on the part not devoted to a road \u2022for vehicles. Section 161 authorizes it at any time to use such portion for specified purposes. Section 142 defines a \u201cboulevard\u201d as a broad strip of land, upon which must exist a well-built road for vehicles, and upon which may be constructed and maintained a railway and other utilities. The act further requires the construction of the road for vehicles within six years, but does not expressly limit the time within which the other utilities are to be constructed. Held, that the Legislature could not have intended that the public use could be indefinitely postponed, and the corporation, by accepting the provisions of the statute, is bound to devote the whole of the land to a public purpose within a reasonable time, which use may be enforced by the courts, or appropriate penalties imposed for a failure to devote it to such use.</p> <p>17. Eminent Domain\u2014Exercise of Delegated Power.</p> <p>The power of eminent domain cannot be exercised, unless the property taken is to be devoted to a public use within a reasonable time thereafter.</p> <p>18. Statutes\u2014Partial Invalidity\u2014Eminent Domain.</p> <p>If 26 Del. Laws, c. 189, authorizing boulevard corporations to condemn land for boulevard purposes, does exempt such corporations from devoting the land to public purposes indefinitely, it is to that extent only invalid.</p> <p>19. Constitutional Law\u2014Construction in Favor of Constitutionality.</p> <p>While statutes delegating the power of eminent domain are strictly construed, and restricted to their clear expression and intention, the usual presumptions apply in favor of their constitutionality, and the court should so construe them, if possible, as to sustain their constitutionality.</p> <p>20. Constitutional Law\u2014Legislative Powers\u2014Delegation to Corporations.</p> <p>26 Del. Laws, c. 189, authorizing the construction by a boulevard corporation of a boulevard throughout the whole length of the state, creating a commission to have the absolute discretion of determining the feasibility and desirability of the route, requiring plans to be filed with the Secretary of State, and providing that they cannot be filed until approved by the state commission, is not invalid as delegating to the corporation the power of determining whether a state highway shall be constructed; the Legislature having itself determined that it shall be.</p> <p>21. Constitutional Law\u2014Legislative Powers\u2014Delegation to Corporations.</p> <p>That a boulevard is to be used in part as a road for vehicles does not preclude the state from delegating to corporations the right to condemn land therefor.</p> <p>22. Constitutional Law\u2014Delegation of Power\u2014Construction and Operation of Legislative Acts.</p> <p>26 Del. Laws, c. 189, authorizing the construction of boulevards by corporations, part to be used as a road for vehicles and part for other public utilities, and providing that the corporation may grant, lease, or otherwise dispose o\u00a3 any of its franchises, does not authorize such corporations to transfer their right of eminent domain, and hence is not invalid as constituting a delegation of the state's sovereign power.</p> <p>23. Corporations\u2014Franchises\u2014Grant\u2014Validity.</p> <p>That 26 Del. Laws, c. 189, grants to boulevard corporations franchises ordinarily exercised by separate and distinct corporations, does not render it invalid.</p> <p>24. Constitutional Law\u2014Delegation of Sovereignty.</p> <p>26 Del. Laws, c. 189, authorizes the construction of boulevards by corporations, the part to be used for vehicles to be conveyed to and maintained by the state, and authorizes the corporation to institute actions to compel the state to maintain such part of the boulevard in as good condition as when conveyed to it. Held that, while the authorization to institute such actions may be unwise, it is not invalid, as a delegation of the state\u2019s sovereign powers; the question of whether the necessity for repairs exists or not being in every case a question determinable by the court, and not the corporation, especially as there is nothing in the act precluding the Legislature from acquiring boulevards from the boulevard corporations by the exercise of the power of eminent domain.</p> <p>25. Prohibition\u2014Scope of Inquiry and Powers of Court.</p> <p>The Supreme Court, on a petition for a writ of prohibition, cannot determine issues of fact dehors the record, raised by the petition, answer, and accompanying affidavits; it having no machinery for the determination of such issues.</p> <p>26. Statutes\u2014Enactment\u2014Passage.</p> <p>26 Del. Laws, c. 189, was constitutionally enacted; the enrolled bill being the one passed by the Legislature.</p>"}
