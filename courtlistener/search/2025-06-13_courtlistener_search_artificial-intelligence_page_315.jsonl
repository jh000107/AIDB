Insurance \u2014 Authority of Agents \u2014 Negligence in Forwarding' Application \u2014 Liability of Company.</p> <p>Agents representing insurance companies in soliciting insurance, can bind the company with regard to matters within the limited and restricted scope of their authority; that is to say, matters pertaining -to the taking and preparation of applications for insurance for submission to the company; and an insurance company is chargeable with the negligence of such agent in failing for an unreasonable length of time to forward an application of insurance for acceptance or rejection to th\u00e9 company.</p> <p>2. Same \u2014 Legal Responsibilities of Companies^ \u2014 Prompt Action -on Applications.</p> <p>Insurance companies are held, in law, to a broader legal responsibility than are parties to purely private contracts or transactions. This is based upon the fact that, those companies act under franchise from the state, and the 'policy of the state in granting such franchises proceeds upon the theory that it is in the interest of the public to the end that indemnity upon specific contingencies should be provided those who are eligible and desire it, and for their protection the state re'gulates, inspects, and supervises their business. -An insurance company having solicited and obtained applications for insurance and having received payment of the fees or premiums exacted, they are bound either to furnish the indemnity the state has authorized them to furnish or decline so to do within such reasonable time as will enable them to act intelligently and advisedly thereon, or suffer the consequences flowing from their neglect so to do.</p> <p>3. Samie \u2014 Solicitors Agents of Company, Not of Applicant.</p> <p>A soliciting agent of an insurance company, in all matters pertaining to the taking of applications for insurance, is the agent of the company, and not of the Insured, and the acts, wrongs, and neglect of the agent are the acts, wrongs, and neglect of the company, and the insurance company cannot limit their responsibility for the acts of said agents and avoid the relation of principal by placing provisions in applications and contracts of insurance limiting their liability, responsibility, or disavowing said acts, and this is so since all such provisions are declared void by statute. (See section 3462, Rev. Laws 1910.)</p> <p>4. Same \u2014 Negligent Delay of Agent in Forwarding Application \u2014 Liability of Company \u2014 Damages.</p> <p>An insurance company may be held liable in damages to an applicant for insurance where there has been unreasonable delay in perfecting and forwarding an application to the company for acceptance or rejection, by the soliciting agent of the company or other agent who has authority to supervise, the solicitation and preparation of applications, and the question of the unreasonableness of the delay is one for the trier of the facts in each particular case under proper instruction of the court.</p> <p>5. Same \u2014 Fire Insurance \u2014 Negligent Delay \u2014Loss by Fire \u2014 Damages.</p> <p>Under the facts in this case, where a soliciting agent procured an application for insurance from the applicants with a note covering the premium, the agent being duly authorized thereunto by the company, but failed to get the proper due date fixed in the note and failed to put in the note the amount required by the, company for deferred payment of the premium, and immediately after delivery of said note and application the general agent discovered the mistakes in drawing the note and the soliciting agent notified the applicants and the applicants instructed the soliciting agent to make the required alterations in the note and the agents of the company retained said note and application without making further demands upon the applicants and failed to make _ the alterations in said note and application as directed, and failed to forward the same to the company at the place designated, and a loss was sustained by the applicants of their property sought to be insured, and there being no contention that there was not a reasonable time to have gotten the application to the company before the loss was sustained, nor reasonable time in which to inspect said risk, nor that said risk was one that the company would not insure, while this state of facts is not sufficient to constitute, in a technical sense, an express or implied contract of insurance, yet it is sufficient to constitute a breach of legal duty and actionable neglect, for which the company is liable to the applicant for whatever damage he reasonably suffered as the proximate result thereof, and the action of the trial court awarding damages upon such a state of facts will not be disturbed upon appeal.</p>"}
