{"absolute_url": "/opinion/3487599/naudain-v-coudon/", "attorney": "Albert Constable  (with whom was  W.S. Evans  on the brief), for the appellant.\n\nWe concede the law that, in the case of a competent testator, his knowledge and approval of the contents of the document he has executed as his will is, as a general rule, to be inferred from the fact of its execution, and that, in the absence of evidence tending to impeach such inference as unreliable and unsatisfactory in view of the facts and circumstances of the particular case, the law regards it as\nconclusive. But, as there also stated, it is equally true that, where a testator is of impaired mind, though not incompetent, or circumstances surround the preparation or execution of an alleged will, which excite a well-grounded suspicion that the testator did not really know and approve the contents, the formal execution of the document ceases to be a satisfactory basis for the inference; that the law, in such cases, demands proof beyond the mere act of formal execution, and that direct proof that the deceased clearly understood and fully intended to make that disposition of his property which the document purports to direct, must be furnished by the party propounding it as his will.\n\nIt was not denied in the Court below, nor could it be in the light of the authorities, that the plaintiff had brought forward such a body of evidence as to Mrs. Naudain's capacity, and as to the circumstances attending the preparation and execution of her alleged will, as made a grave question of fact for the jury on the fourth issue. It was a question to be answered by evidence, not by legal presumptions. And this being so, the jury should have been permitted to answer the question unembarrassed by the injection into their deliberations of legal presumptions of knowledge and understanding, as was done by this 9th prayer; inasmuch as the rule of law by which the proponent of a will gets,  prima facie,  the benefit of a legal presumption of knowledge and approval from mere capacity and bare execution, had no application to this case as it stood when the 9th prayer was offered. No doubt, had the evidence been closed when defendant rested, after proving Mrs. Naudain's formal execution of the paper, the rule could have been properly applied. He would then have had a presumption of capacity, and he would also have proved Mrs. Naudain's execution of the paper. The combined effect of capacity as thus established, and the proof of formal execution of the paper, was such as to entitle him to the legal presumption that Mrs. Naudain understood and approved the contents of the document.\nBut this preliminary proof, at that stage of the case, did not shift the  onus  of satisfying the jury under the fourth issue that Mrs. Naudain understood and approved the contents of the document. That  onus  still rested on the defendant, though, through the medium of an unrebutted presumption of capacity and proof of execution, he had succeeded at that stage of the case, in making  prima facie  proof of it. Had the plaintiff called no evidence, this  prima facie  case he had made would have been conclusive. But the plaintiff  did  call evidence, and the effect of that evidence was such as to show, that defendant's  prima  facie  case for establishing Mrs. Naudain's understanding and approval, which rested merely on an unrebutted presumption of capacity and proof of formal execution, was not a  sufficient \ncompliance with the  onus .\n\n(1.) That being so &#8212; plaintiff having brought into the case that body of evidence which we have before described impeaching as unreliable and unsatisfactory in this case, the inference that Mrs. Naudain understood and approved the contents of this alleged will merely because she had executed it &#8212; defendant was compelled, notwithstanding he had at an earlier stage of the case, been apparently entitled to go before the jury resting upon a mere inference as constituting a  prima facie  proof, to bring forward direct, affirmative evidence to the fact. What then is that direct, affirmative evidence which he brings? It is that the night before the paper was executed Nelson Whitaker read it to Mrs. Naudain. This, no doubt was, if true, an important piece of evidence for the defendant in sustaining his burden of proving that Mrs. Naudain really understood and approved the paper. The defendant, however, was not satisfied with its intrinsic probative force as a fact, but sought in this 9th prayer to obtain for it an additional, artificial force beyond what the jury might be disposed to consider its intrinsic value. He, therefore, asks this 9th instruction in which he states this fact together with her capacity and formal execution of the paper and says, not\nthat the jury from those facts may find that Mrs. Naudain knew and understood the contents of the paper but &#8212; that \"then the legal presumption is that she knew and understood the contents of said paper.\" That is to say, the defendant, although he had introduced evidence tending to prove that Mrs. Naudain had the capacity necessary to execute the document, that it was read over to her and that she had executed it, and had done this for the purpose of proving as a fact that Mrs. Naudain did really understand and approve the document, undertook by this instruction, to  substitute  a legal conclusion for an affirmative finding of the fact. But the case had become one where the testatrix's understanding and approval were to be established as a fact, not a legal conclusion, and by direct, affirmative proof, not by mere inference.\n\n(2.) One effect of this 9th instruction was to enable the jury to evade deciding, if they wished to do so, whether Mrs. Naudain did in fact really understand and approve of the contents of the alleged will. No doubt they were told by plaintiff's 4th prayer that the defendant had the burden of satisfying them that Mrs. Naudain understood the contents of the paper, and that unless the jury were so satisfied the verdict must be for the plaintiff on the 4th issue. But they were not told in what manner, or by what evidence. the defendant must satisfy them.\n\n(3.) What conceivable right had defendant to group certain facts which his evidence tended to prove &#8212; ignoring other facts which plaintiff's evidence tended to prove &#8212; and call on the Court to  emphasize them  and not only so, but to say to the jury that, in addition to their intrinsic probative force, the law gave them an artificial force and raised a legal presumption in favor of the truth of the fact they tended to prove?\n\n(4.) The introduction into this prayer of the term legal presumption is altogether misleading. Even if we concede it was proper, which it was not, to instruct the jury that they might infer  the ultimate fact of understanding and approval\n&#8212; in face of the evidence that this lady's mind was most seriously impaired and that suspicious circumstances existed in this case calling loudly for the utmost vigilance &#8212; it was not proper to speak of such inference of fact which the jury might draw, as a legal presumption, which is something the law draws without the aid of a jury.\n\n(5.) Where the case is one of impaired mind in connection with suspicious circumstances, the law is, not only that there is no legal presumption of the testator's understanding and approval but, that the jury  ought not to be permitted to infer  from such facts as are stated in this 9th prayer, such understanding and approval.  Yardly  v.  Cuthbertson,  108 Pa. St. 305; Cuthbertson's Appeal,  97 Pa. St. 171. In most of the cases the suspicious circumstance occurring was that the person preparing the will was the person taking a benefit under it. But the nature  of the circumstances which ought to excite the vigilance of the Court and call upon those who propound it as a will for evidence more than the mere inference to be derived from a mere formal execution, can make no manner of difference.  Tyrrell  v. Painton,  Law Rep. [1894] Probate, 151.\n\n(6.) Whether the reading over of the will did or did not bring home to Mrs. Naudain an intelligent apprehension of this 26th paragraph was an inference which the jurors were entitled to draw or not according to what they believed to be the condition of her mind at the time, the dialect in which that paragraph was expressed, and the manner in which that reading over had taken place.  Fulton  v.  Andrew,  L.R., 7 Eng. and Irish App. 448.\n\n(7.) The prayer fails to negative the suspicious circumstances which had displaced it. If the evidence brought forward by the plaintiff tended to prove that Mrs. Naudain's mind was impaired, and also, that there were circumstances surrounding the preparation and execution of the document, which raised a well-grounded suspicion that it did not express her true will, then the prayer ought to have been submitted to the jury to find whether that suspicion had\nbeen removed. The theory of the prayer is, that the legal presumption, to be established by the finding of the facts stated therein, sustains the  onus  resting upon defendant, consistently with a full conviction on the part of the jurors that every fact, which the plaintiff's evidence had tended to prove, had been established. But that would be absurd, and is contradicted by the language of every authority upon the subject.  Barry  v. Butlin,  Moore, P.C. 482;  Tyrrel  v.  Painton  [1894], Probate, 157;  Ingram  v.  Wyatt,  1 Hagg. 384.John S. Wirt,  for the appellee.\n\nWe concede the principle that knowledge and approval of the contents of an alleged will by the testator are part of the burthen of proof assumed by one who propounds it as a will. This burthen is satisfied,  prima facie,  in the case of a competent testator by proving that he executed it. If this  prima facie \ncase, however, is met by proof to the contrary, then the party propounding the paper must satisfy the tribunal affirmatively that the testator did know and approve of the contents of the will before it can be admitted to probate.  Cleare and Fowler  v. Cleare,  L.R. 1 Probate and Divorce, 655;  Taylor  v. Cresswell,   45 Md. 427 . The 9th prayer of the defendant and the 4th prayer of the plaintiff taken together, we think, exactly conform to the decisions above cited.\n\nThe defendants below did not rest upon the legal presumption as stated in defendants' 9th prayer, but offered affirmative proof that the testatrix did in fact understand the contents of the will, especially the 26th clause thereof, making provision for her husband. Nelson E. Whitaker testifies that Mrs. Naudain understood the instructions she gave him, and that when the will was read over to her the evening before its execution she thoroughly understood it. He states that there was discussion between them as to the provision for her husband, that she understood it and that it was entirely her own suggestion. This statement is made\nagain and again. Here was positive affirmative proof that the testatrix understood the contents of the will, especially the provisions with reference to her husband.\n\nThe whole contention of the plaintiff was that owing to her enfeebled condition Mrs. Naudain could not understand the technical and involved language of clause 26 of the will. But there is no testimony to support this contention which is mere matter of speculation. There is no proof of \"suspicious circumstances,\" and nothing whatever to impeach the testimony of Nelson E. Whitaker, who is very clear in his statements. In the absence of affirmative testimony that Mrs. Naudain did not understand her will the Court will not enter into a discussion of how far she understood and appreciated the meaning and bearings of particular provisions of her will. As was well said by SIR J.P. WILDE in  Atter  v.  Atkinson,  L.R. 1 P.  D. 665, if Courts permitted such discussions they would upset half the wills in the country.", "caseName": "Naudain v.
