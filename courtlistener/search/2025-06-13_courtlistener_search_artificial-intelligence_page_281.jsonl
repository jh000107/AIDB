It is his duty to look and listen and to exercise such care as is commensurate with his surroundings to avoid the accident. There may be circumstances under.which he should stop, but whether or not this is true depends upon the particular facts of the case, and whether he should stop or not is a matter for the jury to determine.</p> <p>2. Same \u2014 Duty of Railroad \u2014 Warning by Bell or Whistle.</p> <p>Section 1430, Revised Laws of 1910, requires' that a bell at least 30 pounds in weight, or a steam whistle, shall be placed upon each locomotive engine operated upon any railroad of this state, and that such bell shall be rung or such whistle sounded at the distance of at least 80 rods from the place where the railroad shall cross any other road or street, and that the railway company shall be liable for all damages which shall be sustained by any person by reason of the failure of the railroad company to comply with the requirements of the statute. And when a locomotive is so equipped and the bell is rung or the whistle sounded, as required by the statute, then the railway company has discharged the duty imposed upon it by the statute with reference to the ringing of the bell or the sounding of the whistle, whether such signal is heard or not.</p> <p>3. Same \u2014 Statutory Provisions \u2014 Intent.</p> <p>The statute which requires a railroad company to give certain signals at highway crossing was not intended to furnish a standard by which- to determine in every case whether or not such company had failed to discharge its duty in respect to giving sufficient warnings to the traveling public of the approach of its trains. It was intended rather to prescribe the minimum of care which must be observed in all cases.</p> <p>4. Same \u2014 Care Required at Dangerous Crossings.</p> <p>Where a crossing is unusually dangerous because of its peculiar construction and situation, it is the duty of the railway company to exercise such care and take such precautions as the dangerous nature of the crossing requires.</p>"}
