{"absolute_url": "/opinion/3573466/manchester-keene-railroad-v-keene/", "attorney": "W. E. Chandler (with whom were Briggs  Huse), for the plaintiffs.\" A majority of the referees find that on the first day of December, 1878, the railroad of the plaintiff corporation was constructed from Greenfield to the terminus in Keene, and was reasonably safe, fit, and convenient for the public use and accommodation, as new railroads are ordinarily used in similar localities. Upon the foregoing facts, a majority of the referees find that the railroad from Greenfield to the terminus in Keene was completed for use on the first day of December, 1878.\" If the majority of the referees had simply reported that the road was \"completed for use,\" December 1, 1878, their decision would have been solely a finding of fact which the court would not revise. But they concluded that determining what kind of completion for use the contract with Keene fairly required was the decision of a question of law, and that finding that the completion was actually of the kind required settled a question of fact. In Worcester Medical Institution v. Harding and Bigelow, 11 Cush. 285, it was decided that the meaning of the phrase in a building contract, \"when the walls shall be completed,\" \"is a question of law for the court; and whether the necessary acts were done is a question for the jury.\" As matter of law, then, did the contract of Keene to pay the gratuity when the road should be \"completed for use\" from Greenfield to Keene, require any higher standard of completion than that adopted by a majority of the referees?\n\nThe plaintiffs contend that the requirement that the road should be \"completed for use\" meant only that it should be so constructed\nas to be capable of reasonably safe, fit, and convenient use for traffic, as has been usual and customary in the case of other new roads in similar localities when first used, and not that it should be brought to that perfect and final condition to which contractors, under specifications, might be required to bring it, and which railroads seldom, if ever, reach until months, and sometimes years, after they are put in operation.\n\nThe meaning proposed is that naturally to be derived from the words adopted. There being evidently different stages of completion of a railroad, the words \"for use\" were intentionally added to define the particular stage stipulated for, &#8212; that in which the road should be capable of use; meaning safe, suitable, and convenient use, and no more.\n\nSuch was the natural contract to be made between the city and the railroad company. The city was making a donation to get a new railroad opened to it. If the track should be laid, and the road be once made ready for operation, the city would be sure of all it desired; for there would be no doubt that it would be opened and put in operation, and would continue to be run. No failure of these results ever was known in this state; none was anticipated; and none did the city care to provide; or actually provide, against.\n\nThe railroad company was to build its road on credit, by assigning to the contractors donations to come from municipalities. The contractors were also to build on credit, relying on prompt payment of such donations. To wait an indefinite period after the road should be opened, engaged in controversies as to what was completion, might bankrupt the company and contractors. Hence it was most natural to define completion as meaning suitable \"for use,\" or \"for operation,\" or to require that \"the track should be laid,\" or the road \"opened for traffic.\"\n\nThese have been the usual contracts in cases of municipal aid to railroads; and no case can be found, of the hundreds in the reports, where there has been a condition for minute or final completion or for a completion according to specifications.\n\nIn Packard v. County Com'rs, 2 Col. 338, the subscription was to be paid \"$16,000 when one third the road-bed is graded; $17,000 when two thirds are graded; and balance when entire road-bed is graded, with bridges and cross-ties provided.\"\n\nIn Hodgman v. Chicago  St. Paul Railway Co.,  20 Minn. 48  and 23 Minn. 153 , the bonds were not to be issued \"unless said railway shall be fully constructed, equipped, and put into successful operation for the transit of freight and passengers from St. Paul to said Red Wing, on or before January 1, 1871.\"\n\nIn Johnson County v. Thayer,  94 U.S. 631 , the condition was that the company should \"construct and put in operation\" the railroad.\n\nIn Moultrie v. Savings Bank,  92 U.S. 631 , the words are, that the bonds shall not be issued \"until the said road shall be opened for traffic.\"\n\nThe Illinois statute authorized municipal aid to be \"paid to said company as soon as the track of said road shall have been located and constructed through said city, town, or township respectively.\" See Concord v. Savings Bank,  92 U.S. 625 .\n\nIn this way the cases proceed, with language varying more or less, requiring \"completion,\" or completion \"fit for operation,\" or \"completion and operation,\" but in no single instance establishing a requirement as to condition of road which would not be satisfied by a finding that the road was reasonably safe, fit, and convenient for the public use and accommodation, as new roads are ordinarily used in similar localities.\n\nThe question of completion, within the meaning of contracts, having been usually treated as a question of fact, there are few reported decisions to aid in determining the true legal standard of \"completion for use\" in this case.\n\nIn Ogden v. Kirby, 79 Illinois 555, a subscription was payable provided the railroad should be completed and in operation to Menominee by July 1, 1872; and it was held that the question when the road was completed and in operation was purely a question of fact for the jury. But the presiding judge having instructed the jury to render a verdict for the defendant unless the railroad, on or before July 1, 1872, afforded at Menominee reasonable facilities to the public, both as to passenger business and freight business, to receive and discharge the same, the court held the instructions erroneous. Craig, J., says, &#8212; \"The question . . . was foreign to the inquiry. It is a fact which falls under the observation of every one, that a new road but recently completed cannot afford the facilities for receiving and discharging freight and passengers that can be afforded by a road that has an established business, and has had the time and means to construct depots, freight-houses, and the various buildings necessary to facilitate and accommodate the travel and commerce of the country; and yet, by the instructions, the jury were told that unless reasonable facilities were shown, the road could not be considered in operation. Reasonable facilities, we presume, would mean such as were ordinarily afforded by the established railroads of the country. This road was required to be completed on the first day of July, 1872. These instructions required its facilities on the day of its completion to equal those of established roads; and the jury, under the instructions, did not even have the right to take into consideration the age of the road and the condition of the country through which it was constructed.\" The jury had also been instructed, that if they found that the road, on July 1, 1872, had no agent at Menominee, and that the only regular trains then running to Menominee were freight trains running to lumber mills there, they should find for the defendant; and these instructions were held erroneous. Craig, J., says, &#8212; \"It was the province of the jury, and not of the court, to determine what constituted the operation of the road. It\nwas a question of fact, and not of law; and yet, notwithstanding this, one fact is singled out by the instructions, and the jury ale directed that the existence of that fact, as a matter of law, does not constitute the operation of the road. If freight cars were run over the road prior to July 1, 1872, to the village of Menominee, and delivered freight, as was established by evidence, this was a fact proper for the consideration of the jury, tending to prove that the road was in operation at that time; and the appellants were entitled to the full benefit of this fact before the jury in their deliberations. The instruction, however, took the consideration of this fact from the jury.\"\n\nIn Hodgman v. Chicago  St. Paul Railway Co.,  20 Minn. 48 , above referred to, there was, on January 1, 1871, a substantial gap or break in the road, which continued until December, 1871, and there was also no bridge over the Mississippi; and an injunction was granted against the issue of the bonds. In  23 Minn. 158 , this decision was reversed on appeal; and it was held, that the vote \"did not require the company to construct a bridge at Hastings, but to provide such facilities for passing the river as at the time of making the contract were usual and customary under like circumstances in railroad transportation across said stream, and as were adequate and reasonably convenient in reference to such mode of transit.\" In Worcester Medical Institution v. Harding and Bigelow, 11 Cush. 285, \"a subscription to build a medical college was payable, one third when the walls should be completed. Held, that such subscription was payable when the walls were so far completed as to receive the roof, although the walls had not then been covered with mastic, according to the complete designs of the building.\" Under the acts of congress of July, 1862, and July, 1864, there were issued bonds of the United States to aid in the construction of a railroad to the Pacific coast as follows: To the Union Pacific Railroad Company, on 1,029 miles, $27,236, 512; to the Central Pacific Railroad, on 881 miles, $25,885,120. The bonds were to be issued to the companies in installments, as fast as twenty-mile sections of their roads should be completed; and after they were all so issued, a final examination of the roads was made by a commission of eminent citizens, appointed by special act of congress of April 10, 1869, who made a report to the secretary of the interior (published as Senate Exec. Doc., No. 90, 41st Cong., 2d Session), in which they find deficiencies on the Central Pacific road amounting to $576,650, and on the Union Pacific of $1,586,100. The deficiencies to be supplied included large sums for ballasting track widening embankments, filling trestles, building and strengthening bridges, making permanent water-ways, replacing cottonwood ties, building engine-houses and machine shops, building freight and passenger depots, and correcting location and reducing grades.\n\nThe practical difference between a provisional and final completion,\njustifying the issue of all the bonds before or when the road was opened, was recognized by Mr. Attorney-General Evarts in an opinion given in 1869, published in the Opinions of the Attorneys-General. After the roads were opened, controversy arose between the companies and the United States, under the following clause in section 6 of the act of 1862: \"After said road is completed, until said bonds and interest are paid, at least five percentum of the net earnings of said road shall also be annually applied to the payment thereof.\"\n\nThe question was, whether the obligation to commence paying the five per cent. to the United States took effect when the road was provisionally completed for use and the final deliveries of bonds made in 1869, or not until October 1, 1874, when another commission reported that the deficiencies above recited had been duly supplied, and that the road was fully and finally completed. The supreme court held that the companies, having applied for and received all the bonds from the United States on their claim of completion, were estopped to deny such completion for the purposes of the above section 6. But at no time was the delivery of $53,000,000 of bonds to the companies on or before the opening of the road censured or attacked. When the Central Pacific case was before the circuit court in California, Sawyer, J. (4 Sawy. C. C. 362) held, that the road was not completed, within the meaning of the five per cent. clause, until October 1, 1874. The following are extracts from his opinion: \"To bring a railroad up to first-class, as a practical business proceeding, requires time after the mere laying of the rails.\" \"Ordinary practical business economy requires temporary structures, to be gradually replaced as they become unfit for use, and ballasting to be a progressive work, affording time for the embankments to settle by use and to be rendered compact by rains.\" \"The construction of this road was pushed forward with unprecedented energy and haste, for the purpose of getting it open for traffic. When this object was accomplished, the defendants subsequently acted upon sound, practical, economical business principles, and brought the road up to the standard required, by correcting locations, widening cuts and embankments, substituting permanent for temporary structures, ballasting, furnishing water stations, depots, sidings, equipments, etc., by degrees, in the same mode as the testimony shows is usual in the construction and equipment of other extensive first-class roads.\" \"The road is, doubtless, better for being gradually brought to the required standard.\" \"A very inferior road is capable of use, and sometimes of a profitable use.\" Mr. Justice Bradley delivered the opinion of the U.S. supreme court (U. P. Railroad v. U.S.,  99 U.S. 402 , and U.S. v. C. P. Railroad,  99 U.S. 449 ), and there is taken therefrom the following: First, When was the road completed? . . . In one sense a railroad is never completed. There is never, or hardly ever, a time when something more cannot\nbe done, and is not done, to render the most perfect road more complete than it was before. This fact is well exemplified by the history of the early railroads of the country. At first, many of them were constructed with a flat rail, or iron bar, laid on wooden string-pieces, resulting in what was known in former times as snake-heads &#8212; the bars becoming loose, and curving up in such a manner as to be caught by the cars and forced through the floors amongst the passengers. Then came the T rail; and finally the H rail, which itself passed through many successive improvements. Finally, steel rails in the place of iron rails have been adopted as the most perfect, durable, safe, and economical rails on extensive lines. of road. Bridges were first made of wood, then of stone, then of stone and iron. Grades originally crossed, and in most cases do still cross, highways and other roads on the same level. The most improved plan is to have them, by means of bridges, pass over or under intersecting roads. A single track is all that is deemed necessary to begin with; but now no railroad of any pretensions is considered perfect until it has at least a double track. Depots and station-houses are at first mere sheds, which are deemed sufficient to answer the purpose of business. These are succeeded, as the means of the company admit, by commodious station- and freight-houses, of permanent and ornamental structure. And so the process of improvement goes on, &#8212; so that it is often a nice question to determine what is meant by a complete, first-class railroad; and if a question of right or obligation between parties depends upon the completion of such a structure, courts are obliged to spell out, from the circumstances of the case and the language and acts of the parties, what they mean when they use such terms.\"\n\nFurther to argue so plain a question, with such authorities cited, seems superfluous. What more can Keene fairly or possibly ask, than that the road shall be reasonably safe, fit, and convenient for the public use and accommodation? This was all Keene wished to accomplish as the object of her donation. The amount of her gratuity was fixed, and not to be increased or diminished according to the kind of road built. She laid down no specifications, made no condition even that the road should be operated, but only that it should be completed for use, &#8212; that is, fitted for operation, &#8212; paid no attention to the work during its construction, pointed out no defects, and never expressed any dissatisfaction with the road until it was in full operation, and then gave no details of complaint whatever. Where is the different standard of completion that she is entitled to set up now for the first time? It has never been defined in any explicit form of words, and cannot be, without exposing its unreasonableness. If it was enough to build a railroad reasonably safe, fit, and convenient for the public use and accommodation, it needs no argument to show that the qualifying words \"as new railroads are ordinarily used in similar localities\" were sound limitations. Do the defendants contend that under the Keene vote\nthe plaintiffs, to be entitled to the gratuity, were bound to have ready December 1, 1878, a new railroad with all the qualities of an old railroad, or that they were bound to provide a railroad suitable for other and different localities, as, for instance, a road as level as that along the Platte valley, or with as good a track as that between New York and Philadelphia, or Boston and. Lowell, or the White House and the Elberon cottage? It is to be borne in mind, that the words \"completed for use\" are those of the city and not of the railroad company, and are therefore to be construed strictly against the former and liberally toward the latter. Keene might have added further words, and stipulated for any kind or standard or test of completion for use she chose, but she preferred to stand solely on those three words, and has never yet fairly stated what she contends they mean; and they are not therefore to be harshly construed to relieve her from a just liability, and to impoverish her creditors, who nearly three years ago fulfilled all obligations reasonably to be implied from the three words used.\n\nThe standard of completion which the plaintiffs believe to be just and fair, was stated in a printed brief submitted to the referees in the opening of the hearing, and was substantially the standard now contended for. The defendants' counsel really never set up any standard of completion, but contended that the referees must not hold that the words \"completed for use\" meant anything less than the word \"completed\" alone would mean; and they stood and still stand captiously contending that every specific, petty defect or deficiency, which they or their experts hunted up long after Keene's liability was fixed, prevents a \"completion for use,\" and defeats a recovery. Those defects and deficiencies are stated in the referees' report. Did they prevent the road, on December 1, 1878, from being reasonably safe, fit, and convenient for the public use and accommodation, as new: railroads are ordinarily used in similar localities? The referees find that they did not. Will the court overrule their finding of fact? Did these defects and deficiencies, as matter of law, require the adoption of a standard of completion for use different from that of the referees, to which they find this railroad, notwithstanding those defects and deficiencies, conformed? \"The referees find that the sum of $20,000 would have made good all of said deficiencies, including fences and depots.\" The whole thirty miles of road cost $600,000. Are deficiencies, mainly for fences and depots, which $20,000 would overcome, fatal to \"completion for use\"? Was the road not completed for use, if there were no terminal facilities nor rolling-stock, when those of the connecting roads were used, and the road had been leased to a connecting road before construction, in pursuance of express statute authority? Was the road not completed for use, if there were $881 unpaid land damages on 6,431 feet out of 29 1/2 miles of road, all duly assessed, and tendered in all cases but one, &#8212; the referees finding that the land-owners had waived any\nright to interfere with the road, because they had never attempted or threatened to disturb it? (In McAulay v. Western Vermont Railroad, 33 Vt. 311 ,  it was held, that although payment of land damages is a condition precedent, yet it is a condition for the benefit of the land-owner, and may be waived by him, even by parol; and that where he acquiesces in the occupation of the land without prepayment, and the road is constructed and put in operation, he cannot afterwards maintain ejectment or trespass.) Do the numberless freshets, slides, wash-outs, derailments, dilapidations, stop-pages, insolvencies, controversies, losses, and other incidents historically connected with this railroad, which have all happened since the road was completed for use, December 1, 1878, and demand for payment made of Keene on the 5th of December, require any different standard of completion for use to be adopted by which to determine the liability of Keene on said 5th of December? To ask these questions is to answer them.\n\nAt the risk of repetition and prolixity, we restate the question. There can be but two methods of dealing with it. One is to treat the question of \"completion for use\" as a pure question of fact, as the cases generally do. Then the finding of the referees is conclusive on the whole case, and the court will not revise it. The other is (like the court in 11 Cushing and the referees), to consider the meaning of the word \"completed\" in the contract as a question of law, and the question whether the necessary acts were done, one of fact. Then the only question for the court is, whether the referees rightly interpreted the meaning of the words \"completed for use.\" If they did, and have found that the road was completed within that meaning, the court will approve their interpretation, accept their finding as conclusive, and render final judgment according to their award.\n\nThe referees clearly state their interpretation of the words \"completed for use;\" that they meant that the road should be so constructed as to be \"reasonably safe, fit, and convenient for the public use and accommodation, as new railroads are ordinarily used in similar localities.\" That interpretation is sensible, just, correct, and sustained by reason and authority, as we have endeavored to show. The plaintiffs promptly stated their view of the meaning of the words \"completed for use:\" \"that it should be so constructed as to be capable of safe use for traffic, as has been usual and customary in the case of other new roads when first used, and not that it should be brought to that perfect and final condition to which contractors, under specifications, might be required to bring it, and which railroads seldom if ever reach until months, and sometimes years, after they are put into operation.\"\n\nThe defendants stated their first view: That if the referees should decide that the road was completed for use, \"and should adopt the view that the words `for use,' in the resolution of the city councils, qualify the word `completed' in such a way that the\nphrase `completed for use' is satisfied by a railroad less complete and perfect than would fairly answer to the term `completed' alone, then the defendants desire to have the condition of the road at the time it may be found to be `completed for use' stated sufficiently in detail, so that the construction of the resolution in this respect may be presented to the court. It then becomes a mixed question of law and fact, &#8212; law, so far as regards the interpretation of the language of the resolution, and fact, so far as regards the actual condition of the road. It is a question for the court whether the law is correctly applied to the facts.\" The defendants' second standard is as follows: \"The road must be completed for use: not partially completed, so that the work of completion may be carried on and finished alongside a partial and precarious use for traffic. We do not mean, made to be a perfect railroad. No road probably was ever completed in that sense; but we claim that it must be in a condition such that a fair man, of sound judgment and practical common-sense, one experienced in such things and having no interest in the result, would say it is a completed road, ready for use in the way railroads are ordinarily used for public traffic, the carrying of freight and passengers.\" The referees' definition of a road, \"completed for use,\" rejects the negative portion of that of the plaintiffs, adds to the requirement of safety for use those of fitness and convenience, and limits the requisites to such as may be appropriate to the locality of the road. What do the referees omit which the defendants had a right to ask?\n\nThe defendants' first standard is no standard at all. Their request is really this: If you think that \"completion for use\" is anything less than \"completion\" alone, and find the road to be completed, then report all the facts so that we may ask the court to revise your decision of fact and find the road to be not completed. To justify this demand, they say, \"It then becomes a mixed question of law and fact.\" Suppose it does: it by no means follows, that, under an extremely indefinite and dangerous proposition that the court is then to decide \"whether the law is correctly applied to the facts,\" the court will proceed, on the referees' report, to revise, and decide the other way, the intricate and contested questions of fact the evidence on which occupied three weeks' hearing! Under such claim of a right to see that \"the law is correctly applied to the facts,\" the court might easily control or reverse every verdict of a jury that is ever rendered. If the question before the referees was really a mixed one of law and fact, the court will look only to see whether the referees have fairly and candidly stated the legal principle by which they undertook to guide their action, and whether that principle appears to be sound and correct. If so, the court will not look closely into the facts, but will approve the finding of the referees that the facts made a case requiring their ultimate decision. The principle clearly stated by the referees was, that the contract required that the railroad should be\nconstructed so as to be \"reasonably safe, fit, and convenient for the public use and accommodation, as new railroads are ordinarily used in similar localities.\" The defendants' first standard gives no suggestion that would enable the court to amend this principle, but only demands that they shall be furnished with the means of appealing from the decision of the referees on a \"mixed question of law and fact\" &#8212; that is, on both law and fact &#8212; to the court. But at last the defendants state something like a standard or principle, by which to determine, as matter of law, what would be \"completion for use.\" We call attention to their second standard. (1) If a road is substantially completed, we say it is clearly sufficient, although it may not be in a final or perfect condition of completion; that is, although it may be what counsel calls (but the referees do not call) partially completed for a partial and precarious use for traffic. There is great latitude in the meaning of adjectives. \"Substantial\" is the proper legal word by which to determine whether there was performance: substitute substantially for not partially, and substantial for partial and precarious. (2) Again: It is no concise and accurate definition of \"completion for use\" to say that it requires that the road must be \"in a condition such that a fair man, of sound judgment and practical commonsense? one experienced in such things and having no interest in the result, would say it is completed.\" Those words merely demand good witnesses or a competent tribunal; but they can be no part of the true definition we are seeking: they make a confusion of ideas. (3) It must be conceded that the road was sufficiently \"completed for use,\" if it was ready for public use as new roads are ordinarily used in similar localities. In their request for further findings, the defendants do not complain of the soundness of these qualifying words, only that the referees did not inform the counsel beforehand that they intended to use them. The defendants' second standard, revised and corrected, is, that the road must be completed for use &#8212; substantially completed, so that the work of final and perfect completion may be carried on and finished alongside a substantial use for traffic. We do not mean made to be a perfect railroad. No road probably was ever completed in that sense; but we claim that it must be . . . a completed road, ready for use in the way new railroads are ordinarily used in similar localities for public traffic, &#8212; the carrying of freight and passengers. That is a good standard, equivalent to but not quite so concise as that the road must be \"reasonably safe, fit, and convenient for the public use and accommodation, as new railroads are ordinarily used in similar localities.\" If it is possible to evolve, from all the obscurity with which the defendants' \"mixed questions of law and fact\" are stated, the conclusion that they do not object to the referees' standard, but only make what is in the nature of a motion for a new trial on the ground that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence, we submit that no such case of palpable\nerror is made out as would justify the interference of the court, even if a referee's report should ever be set aside on such grounds.\n\nW. S. Ladd, for the defendants. In the plaintiffs' argument it is said, &#8212; \"If there was any contract here at all, it was mutual, and bound both parties from the time the Keene vote was accepted by the company, and it began work on the road.\" We would like to know wherein the mutuality consists. What did it bind the Manchester  Keene Railroad Corporation to do? It is important to settle in the outset, if we can, what were the true legal relations established between the city and the railroad corporation by the passage of the resolution and the notification that it was accepted. If the statement above quoted from the plaintiffs' brief means anything, it must mean, so far as we can see, that the railroad corporation thereby came under a legal obligation to build the road and Keene under an obligation to make them a gift of so much money when it was built. That would constitute a mutual contract resting for its consideration upon mutual promises to be performed in the future. But that is not so. Such votes have never been looked at in that way by courts or law writers; and such was not the fact of the transaction. There was no stipulation on the part of the railroad corporation that they would build the road. They came under no legal obligation to do so. Keene could have maintained no action against them for an omission to do so. The whole significance of the vote accepting the gratuity was, as we submit, simply this, &#8212; that the railroad corporation would accept the gift with the condition imposed. We say the transaction wanted exactly what the plaintiffs say it had, namely, the element of mutuality, to make it a contract in the usual and ordinary acceptation of that term. It resembles much more a gift offered upon certain conditions, to go into effect on a future day, provided those conditions were performed.\n\nKeene was not contracting for the building of a railroad. It could not lawfully have done so. The municipality was not to have any interest or property in the road when completed. It was simply the promise of a gift, to be consummated by delivery in case the railroad should choose to perform, and should perform, the conditions upon Which it was offered, leaving the beneficiaries at full liberty to perform those conditions or not, as they chose. It makes no difference what this be called, if we only keep distinctly in mind what it really was. But if we call it a contract and by the use of that word allow ourselves to confound it with a contract for the building of a house, or a ship, or a railroad, we shall lose sight of a vital distinction, and inevitably find ourselves applying legal principles in its interpretation which have no just or proper application, and which must therefore lead to grossly erroneous results. Was there an hour from the passage of the resolution to the time when the referees find the road was completed\nfor use (September 1, 1880), when the railroad corporation could not have drawn back and said, \"We go no further in the performance of this condition,\" without furnishing any cause of action to Keene for the breach of a contract? We suppose there can be but one answer to this question, namely, that there was not. Then does it not follow that it was a contract (if it was a contract at all) by which one of the parties was not bound to do, or to abstain from doing, any act or thing whatever? Where, then, is the absurdity of calling it a unilateral contract, &#8212; a contract under and by virtue of which the nature and extent of the rights and obligations of the parties were left wholly to the option of one of those parties?\n\nA word further as to the character of this transaction. It is the appropriation of public money as a gift to promote an enterprise in almost every aspect private in its character. Scarcely a court have ever held that such a thing could be done without violating the constitution of the state where it was attempted, that have not given strong expression to their regret that they found themselves unable to hold the other way. \"A system which puts the property of tax-paying citizens against their will into a railroad corporation is little better than confiscation. It has proved a calamity in most instances,\" says that very judicious writer, Mr. Pierce, after looking over and citing the cases on the subject decided by the American courts. Pierce R. R. 89. Judge Dillon, speaking of the same thing, says, &#8212; \"Regarded in the light of its effects, however, there is little hesitation in affirming that this invention to aid private enterprises has proved itself baneful in the last degree.\" Dill. Mun. Cor., s. 104. This consideration furnishes no reason for denying these plaintiffs in interest their legal rights in this case. It does furnish a reason, however, against stretching, and distorting, and misapplying the well understood doctrines of law and equity, to enable them to recover against this municipal corporation money to which, upon a fair and reasonable interpretation and application of the law, they have no right. It furnishes a reason, if any were needed, why the idea that time is not usually of the essence of a contract should not be imported and misapplied where it has no just or proper application at all; and it furnishes a reason why the corporation should be held to a full and strict performance of the conditions precedent upon which the gift was voted before a recovery can be had.\n\nThe plaintiffs say time is not essential; or at any rate that, if the resolution contains any provision with respect to the time of completion of the road, it is not made an essential condition precedent. \"Equity abhors penalties,\" c. If A contracts with B to build a house for him for $3,000, and it is stipulated that it shall be done by a certain day, and when the day comes round the house is not quite but nearly completed, A shall not certainly and absolutely lose all he has done towards a performance which has been beneficial to B. So, if the proprietors of a railroad contract with\nA to build a road for them, and it is stipulated that it shall be done by a certain day, the same doctrine would undoubtedly apply. So, if a town enters into a lawful contract to take and pay for a certain amount of the stock of a railroad, and it is stipulated that the road shall be completed by a certain day, the same principle would apply. But this is as far as the cases go. The Missouri case, cited in the plaintiffs' brief (Railroad v. Nodaway Co.,  47 Mo. 349 ), goes just as far as the last supposition alone, and no further. That was a contract to subscribe for stock in the road; and that contract contained no condition that the stock should be taken only in case the road should be completed by a given time. The plaintiffs' counsel happen to omit, in quoting from the case, the word which makes it utterly inapplicable in the present, and throws it clearly and fully into the category above. The county, by its authorized agents, subscribed for 1250 shares of stock, &#8212; that is, made a contract, on behalf of the county, to take and pay for so many shares, to be paid for, so and so, in bonds of the county. \"And the subscription stipulated that said road should be finished to a point one mile from said court-house by May 1, 1870,\" c. This word \"stipulated\" puts an entirely different aspect on the case, so that it is not in conflict with the uniform and unbroken current of cases wherever this question has been at all considered. The time for completion was not made a condition at all. It is competent for a municipal corporation to make its subscription upon condition that the road shall be completed within a certain time, or upon such other condition as may be considered necessary or desirable, to insure the corporation against loss; and as between the parties such condition will be enforced. Jones Ry. Sec., s. 273, and cases cited in note. A municipal corporation, like an individual, is not bound by its subscription, unless the conditions expressed therein are complied with. Pierce R. R. 99, citing Bucksport  B. R. Co. v. Brewer, 67 Me. 295 ; Virginia  T. R. Co. v. Lyon County,  6 Nev. 68 ; Campbell Co. v. Knoxville  K. R. Co., 6 Cold. 598. State v. Daviess County,  64 Mo. 30 ; Cooper v. Sullivan County,  65 Mo. 542 ; Wagner v. Meety,  69 Mo. 150 ; Falconer v. Buffalo  J. R. Co.,  69 N.Y. 491 ; People v. Clayton,  88 Ill. 45 ; People v. Waynesville,  88 Ill. 469 ; Parker v. Smith, 3 Brad. (Ill.) 356; Bittinger v. Bell,  65 Ind. 445 ; Merrill v. Welsher,  50 Iowa 61 . These cases, upon examination, seem to be in point. See, also, P.  O. Cent. R. v. Hartford,  58 Me. 23 , County of Moultrie v. Savings Bank,  92 U.S. 631 , and all the cases referred to in the plaintiffs' brief, where the matter comes in question either directly or incidentally. It will be observed, that most of the cases to be found in the books are where the vote was to take stock in the corporation, thus giving the city or town a legal interest in the thing their money is used to procure, and a voice in its control and management. We submit that the broad reasons which have led courts uniformly to treat such provisos as conditions precedent, to\nbe fully and strictly performed before the city or town can be held to pay, or to issue their bonds, apply with double force here, where the vote was to make a mere gift.\n\nWe now call attention to the position of the real plaintiffs before the court. They are not the holders of negotiable bonds seeking the opinion of the court as to the validity of their securities; but they present themselves in the very novel attitude of assignees of the interest or right of the Manchester  Keene Railroad to the gratuity. In fact, they bring their suit in the name of that defunct corporation. No parallel case has been found in the books. The cases are numerous where the question of the validity of bonds issued by municipal corporations in aid of railroads has been discussed; and there is danger, however much we may guard our minds against it, that an analogy will be allowed between those cases and the present, when none at all exists; that we shall unconsciously give way to the feeling that these plaintiffs in interest stand somewhat in the position of holders of negotiable paper, who have paid value for it. The plaintiffs themselves have, we fear, already yielded wholly to this very incorrect view of their situation, and the loud talk of counsel about repudiation would seem to indicate that those gentlemen are in danger of falling into the same mistake. Keene never promised to pay over anything to anybody except the Manchester  Keene Railroad These gentlemen are volunteers, in every sense of the word. They took from Dawe  Bonnallie the interest which that firm had taken from the M.  K. R. R. corporation in the vote of Keene, because they thought it for their pecuniary interest to do so, because they thought they could make money by doing so. In no possible view can they stand at all better than this bubble of a so called corporation would stand were that legal person the sole plaintiff in interest here. And it will be observed that the assignment to them of the vote was made long before the time when a majority of the referees find that the road was in a condition fit to be used as other new railroads in similar localities have been used.\n\nThe plaintiffs in interest claim that the effect of the assignment to them of the pecuniary interest which the corporation had in the vote of Keene was to operate as a full and complete substitution of them for the corporation in all respects; so that Keene having contracted with a certain legal person, which had a well defined and well known character imposed upon it by the law of the land, should be compelled to accept a partial and incomplete performance from another person having a legal character entirely different. This we deny; and we are thus brought to our first point.\n\nI. No substitution of the plaintiffs in interest, or any other natural person in place of the Manchester  Keene Railroad Corporation, with respect to the performance of the contract (calling it a contract), or any part thereof, can lawfully be made either with\nor without the assent of Keene. The resolution clearly contemplated that the road should be completed for use by the M.  K. Corporation and by no one else. This unilateral contract, so far as regards the rights and obligations of Keene, was not assignable The resolution was passed in view of the laws of the state in existence at the time. The duties and obligations laid by law upon either of the parties with respect to the subject-matter of the contract became a part of the contract. In prescribing the general duties of railroad corporations, the legislature were doing no more than marking out and defining the traits, qualities, characteristics, and functions which those artificial persons should possess. It was the creator fixing the character of the thing created. When Keene came to deal with this creation of the legislature, such dealing could not, by any possibility, go on any ground except that the railroad corporation was just the kind of thing which the legislature had made it, subject to all the duties and obligations imposed by the laws of the state on such corporations. This became and was just as much a part of the contract as that Keene was and should continue to be a municipal corporation, capable of exercising just the powers and subject to just the duties by law vested in corporations of that sort. A railroad is good for nothing, to a municipal corporation or to anybody else, unless it is equipped and operated. The law lays upon railroad corporations the duty to equip, maintain, and operate their roads. This is all covered by Gen. St., c. 145, s. 3. It is a compliance with this law, and not the mere existence of a string of iron rails laid upon the ground, that makes a railroad useful or valuable to the public Was it necessary that Keene should expressly stipulate in her resolution that this duty, imposed by law upon the creature she was dealing with, should be performed? Most assuredly not. This vital provision of the law became just as much a part of the contract as though it had been written out at length in the resolution This we regard ad too plain, too well understood, too elementary; for a moment's debate. If that be so, where is the power to abrogate and annul that most important part of the contract any more than any other part of it? It certainly does not exist in the court. It certainly does not exist in the parties. Can the court, or the M. . K. Railroad, or these plaintiffs in interest, do indirectly what the law plainly says neither can do directly? By going through the manoeuvre of substituting a legal person who has none of the obligations with respect to equipping, maintaining, and operating the road resting on him, which are imposed by law upon railroad corporations, can this vital part of the contract be evaded, avoided, nullified? We do not believe any such kind of legal jugglery can find countenance. It is a thing that cannot be done even by the assent and concurrence of Keene itself; for the reason that Keene had no lawful power or authority to give any such assent. That this must be so will be plain, we think, upon a\nmoment's reflection. By the law of this state \"Railroads, being public highways, can be laid out, built, maintained, and put in operation only by virtue of express grants of the legislature, or of authority derived from them.\" Gen. St., c. 146, s. 3. The authority given towns by statute to vote aid to the construction of railroads is by necessary implication confined to such legal persons as may lawfully build railroads; in other words, to incorporated companies, who, in accepting their franchise, assume all the legal obligations imposed by the general laws of the state upon such corporations, as well as those contained in their charter. The conclusion seems to us inexorable, that inasmuch as Keene could not lawfully have voted the gratuity in the first place to any other person than the legal person having authority by law to build a railroad, she could not afterwards lawfully consent to the substitution of a different person, and one who has not the right to build, maintain, or put in operation a railroad, and is not subject to any of the duties in that behalf provided by the law.\n\nBut Keene has not in fact ever assented, or attempted to assent, by any act, or by the omission of any act, to such substitution.\n\nThe only significance of the filing of the assignments in the city clerk's office was simply a notice to the city that, as between the assignors and assignees, the latter were entitled to the money or bonds whenever they should be paid over. But it was no notice of an intention or of an attempt to substitute a natural person having no legal obligation or duty with respect to the maintenance and continued operation of the road, in place of the legal creature with whom they were dealing when they passed the vote, the very vital part of whose organic existence were those very obligations which it is now sought to evade Should it be said that this objection would be met, and may now be met, by requiring the plaintiffs in interest to furnish security in place of the obligations imposed by law on railroad corporations, which shall put the city in as good position in that respect as though the condition had been performed by the corporation, the answer is, that the court have no power to make such order, because it would be substituting a contract which Keene did not make, and had no legal power or right to make, for the one she did make; or, in other words, abrogating the contract made, and substituting in place of it an arrangement which the court think may afford equal protection to the rights of the parties in another way\n\nII. The report shows that the road was not completed for use by anybody within the meaning of the resolution at the date of the writ, and that it has never been so completed.\n\nThe report shows that land damages for about 1 1/4 miles of the road have never been paid; that they were assessed, and tendered in all cases but one; that no part of said unpaid land damages was ever deposited with the state treasurer; and that the corporation has no money or other funds wherewith to pay them. By inadvertence,\nwe suppose, the report does not show, in so many words that appeals were taken in those cases. This was perhaps thought by the referees to be a sufficiently plain inference from what is stated. In what is said on this point the fact of such appeals will be assumed. Is a railroad in this state completed for use before the right of way has been procured, either by contract with the land-owners, or in the mode prescribed by the laws of the state Upon this general question I do not know that any difference of opinion exists between the parties. At all events, it seems safe enough to assume that no one will attempt to argue that a rail road which has not the right of way is completed for use.\n\nBut at this point we are met by certain facts found, and specially reported by the referees, which facts, they say, in their judgment amount to a \"waiver\" by the land-owners of their right to dispossess the plaintiffs. Those facts are, that the corporation entered upon the land, built their road, caused land damages to be assessed, tendered them; and that \"no land-owner has attempted or threatened to disturb the possession of the plaintiffs, or objected to the plaintiffs' occupying the land taken for the road.\" The referees call the effect they give to these facts by the name, waiver of right to dispossess the plaintiffs. The effect sought to be given them by the plaintiffs (and this is the only effect which will meet at all the exigencies of their case) is that of an estoppel in pais, &#8212; an estoppel by conduct, whereby the land-owners have parted with their land to the extent of a perpetual easement in it to be used for a railroad, and the plaintiffs have acquired what the land-owners have thus lost. It makes no difference by what name the referees call the legal effect to be given to these facts; they are before the court, and it is for the court to say whether they show that the corporation has acquired the right of way by reason of the conduct of the parties or not. What have those landowners done to forfeit and lose their right to the possession and enjoyment of their property? Nobody pretends they have done anything except to refuse the tenders. What, then, have they omitted to do? All that the referees find on the subject of omission is, that no one of them has \"attempted or threatened to disturb the possession of the plaintiffs.\" Hence what they call a waiver. Hence really a new statute of limitations substituted for the comfort and convenience of these plaintiffs in interest for the statute law of New Hampshire. It is inconceivable how a man's silence under these circumstances should lose him his farm\n\nIt certainly seems to us very plain indeed, &#8212; very plainly in accord with common-sense, and very plainly in accord with what constitutes a reasonably fair interpretation of a man's conduct, &#8212; that the omission of these land-owners to threaten or attempt to disturb the plaintiffs, meant, not that they intended to give up their land, but, on the other hand, that they intended by their silence to give the corporation most unequivocally to understand\nthat if their land was wanted for railroad purposes, it must be taken from them according to the provisions of the law. The referees say, by refusing the tenders and then remaining silent and keeping the peace, they \"waived\" their right to dispossess the plaintiffs. This, as already suggested, means estoppel, if it means anything that can avail the plaintiffs, whereby the land, or at least the right to its use for a railroad, has passed irrevocably and forever from the owners to the corporation, &#8212; an estoppel by conduct, whereby their mouths are forever shut against saying that they have any right of possession in their land except subject to the overwhelming easement. The right to possess and use things, whether real or personal, constitutes the fundamental idea of property in those things; so that, when a man loses, as to himself and his heirs, forever, the right to possess his farm, he has to all practical intents lost his farm. The interest that remains in him, if any, is much more a matter of sentiment than a thing of commercial value. As already suggested, it does seem to us there is no escaping the conclusion that the decision of the referees on this point, giving it the effect which the plaintiffs claim, comes nothing short of an attempt to put their own judgment, as to what ought to be the period of the statute of limitations in this particular case, in place of the time fixed by law; for the facts reported, as it seems to us, do not show one single element to constitute an estoppel which shall have the effect to pass the title to the land, or divest the owner of his right to possess and enjoy it.\n\nWhat did the corporation do? They went upon the land as they had a right to do, and located their road. They procured damages to be awarded, and tendered the amount, which, being refused, they put back into their treasury, and it is gone. They omitted the very thing which the law and the courts of this state have always guarded with the most jealous care. They omitted to pay the sums awarded to the state treasurer, and furnish security to the acceptance of the county commissioners for the payment of further damages and costs, as required by Gen. St., c. 146, s. 22. \"If the right of acquiring, possessing, and protecting property is a constitutional right, the compulsory taking of the plaintiff's property without payment was an unconstitutional violation of the right, as direct and gross as can possibly be committed. Such a wrong is not an exercise of the power of eminent domain. A compulsory purchase of private property for public use without payment is not a definition of eminent domain, but a florid and periphrastic description of something else. The outrage is not legalized or palliated by the technical, rhetorical, and contradictory description. Calling it a purchase does not make it a purchase. Being compulsory, and being without compensation, it is simply pillage, &#8212; an infraction of the constitution as plain as can be conceived of, if the right of acquiring, possessing, and protecting property is a constitutional one.\" Orr v. Quimby,  54 N.H. 616 .\n\nIn the above case, a majority of the court thought the faith of the national government, impliedly pledged to make full compensation for the damage inflicted upon a citizen by the taking of his property for a use as public as the coast survey, was reasonably sufficient security that it would be done, and might safely be allowed the same-effect as a deposit of money, or the furnishing of approved security for payment. But no man in that court, or, as we believe, in any other court, ever attempted to question the soundness of the doctrine so forcibly expressed in the observations quoted above from the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Doe. Never before have we heard it intimated at the bar, or from the bench, that the land of a citizen can be taken from him without his consent, and devoted to a public use in any other way than the way prescribed and pointed out by the laws of the state; and never before have we heard it suggested from any quarter that the failure of the citizen, by some noisy demonstration of dissent or by a lawless interference with force to prevent the taking, would be followed by the fatal consequence of a loss of his land, not by virtue of a compliance with the requirements of the law by which it may be taken, but by virtue of his own orderly, decent, and peaceable conduct.\n\nWill it be said that the failure of these land-owners to do anything in the way of asserting their legal rights, after the entry to construct and during the period the road has been in use, possesses any greater significance, or can have any greater legal effect, than their failure to interfere by physical force or legal process to prevent the entry? We say no such proposition can for a moment be sustained. There has been no time since the rails were laid down when it would have been wise or proper conduct on the part of one of them to tear up the rails across his land; and it was never yet heard, in this state at least, that a man's land should be taken from him by the court, and given to another who has no better right to it than that the owner's dread of a lawsuit deterred him, for a period less than the statute of limitations, from commencing legal proceedings for the protection and enforcement of his violated rights. If A, with full knowledge of what is going on, stands by and sees B sell, and in his own name convey, his (A's) land to C, and makes no objection, and gives no sign that the land is his, he cannot afterwards impeach the deed of B to C. He has waived his right to dispossess C of the land. In other words, he is estopped by his conduct from saying that B's deed does not make a good title against him. Have these land-owners done anything of that sort here? What they saw going on was an apparent attempt on the part of the railroad to get their land condemned to a particular use according to law. There was no call upon them to speak or to act. Their silence misled nobody; and if it did, had they not a most unquestionable right to remain silent? What right had the railroad to suppose they were going to get the\nland of owners, who did nothing but hold their peace, in any other way than that pointed out by the law? Is the act any the less \"pillage\" because the victims, believing, and having every reason to believe, that their property is being taken from them by a use of the enginery of the law in such cases provided, do not raise a tempest of utterly vain objection, or resort to physical resistance?\n\nIn the early days of railroads in this state, land-owners situated exactly as these are had full legislative authority \"to remove the rails from said railroad, fence up the land, and take and retain possession of the same until entire satisfaction is made to the owner or owners of the land thus taken,\" and this without any preliminary legal process or proceeding for the settling of facts that might be in dispute as to whether the right of way had not been already acquired. Laws Nov. Sess., 1840, c. 584, p. 504. This was giving to a party in interest rather large powers. It was clothing him with authority to determine in his own case when a mandatory order of that sweeping description should be issued, and putting the order in his own hands for service and execution. It savors rather strongly of a return to primitive methods of protecting and defending rights of property, and so the statute did not long remain upon the book in that shape. But if any one should assume that the real sentiment and spirit which prompted the passage of that law in 1840 have disappeared or abated in New Hampshire, they would fall into a grievous error. So long as the people of the state are fit to be trusted with the maintenance of a government for themselves, the rights of private property will be guarded and protected with most jealous care. The rights of landowners are as carefully and as fully protected today, although in a different way, as they were by the statute of 1840. The legislature has done its duty. It would be a strange spectacle indeed to see its work brought to nought by the ingenuity of a board of referees sanctioned by the court. The case of McAulay v. Western Vt. R. R. Co.,  33 Vt. 311 , is not an authority at all in conflict with these views. Indeed, as we read the case, it has no bearing at all. Without stopping now to explore the broad field presented by the diversity of the constitutions and statutes of the two states, and the spirit of interpretation applied by their respective courts where the rights and powers and obligations of corporations are concerned, it is enough to say that the two cases are so broadly distinguished in their facts that the one has no just bearing at, all upon the other. The fact which distinguishes the case thus broadly to our minds is that in that case there was a contract between the plaintiff and the railroad, executed in writing before the land was taken, whereby the plaintiff agreed to take pay for his land damages in stock of the road. It was a clear and absolutely necessary implication from this that his consent was given to their taking the land. Why agree upon the method of payment for a thing they were not going to have? All that was left\nopen was the amount of compensation the owner should receive. Mr. Phelps therefore states the question in the case correctly, in his argument for the defendants, to be \"whether, if the land-owner waives his right to require payment before the occupation of his land, agrees in writing to look to the company for his damages, when ascertained, in a manner different from the mode of payment prescribed by the charter, and permits the construction of the road over his land meanwhile, he can revoke the license after it has been acted on by the erection of expensive and permanent works, and reclaim the premises.\"\n\nThe court of New Hampshire has not yet, as we understand, gone the length of holding that a parol license to do any act upon land cannot be revoked even after the licensee has expended money in erecting costly structures thereunder. Cowles v. Kidder,  24 N.H. 364 ; (Carleton, v. Redington, 21 N.H. 293 .\n\nThat this is a vexed question in other jurisdictions need not be denied. 1 Wn. R. P. 544. There is no view in which that question becomes material in this case, because the general doctrine here and everywhere else is, that a parol license to be exercised upon the land of another is a mere personal privilege, founded in personal trust and confidence, and is not assignable. 1 Wn. R. P. 545 and cases in notes. If, therefore, we should go so far as to concede that the Manchester  Keene corporation did acquire some right here as against the land-owners by way of a license, still, inasmuch as an assignment of everything that ever belonged to that corporation is exceedingly imminent, if it has not already taken place, and inasmuch as such assignment will inevitably, if it has not already, extinguish all possible right that comes by way of parol license, it is impossible to say that the right of way has been acquired in such sense that the road can be called completed for use. A right to use the land over which a railroad has been constructed, which may be extinguished any day by the act of either party, is too precarious to form the basis of a judgment that the railroad is completed for use.\n\nBut this is a digression. It makes no difference what niceties we might run into, provided there were anything like a parol license here, because no such thing exists; and we come back to the broad ground upon which we started out, namely, that when the law points out a mode by which the land of a citizen may be taken from him and devoted to the use of another, whether a natural person, or a corporation created by the state, or the state itself, it is only by pursuing that method that the land can be taken. And it is as contrary to reason and justice and common-sense as it is to the analogies of the law, to hold that the citizen, simply by remaining silent, consents to anything, or waives anything, or gives any license, or submits to have an iron padlock put upon his mouth to prevent him from setting up and asserting any of his rights of property which may have been invaded in the proceeding.\nIt will be observed that in the Vermont case referred to, no question was made but that the land-owner was still entitled to recover his damages; but the exigencies of this case require the court to go very much further before the plaintiff's view can be accepted. Here there is no agreement by the corporation or anybody else to pay, or of the land-owners to accept pay, for the land, as there was in that case. Either the land (or the right to use it forever for a railroad, which comes to the same thing) is gone wholly from the land-owners to the Manchester  Keene Railroad Corporation, or it is not. If it is gone, no obligation rests upon the corporation or anybody else to pay for it by virtue of any provision of the statute, or by any doctrine that we ever heard of to be found in the common law. If the title is not gone, then it is still in the land-owners, and they can most assuredly assert it. It is no answer to say that it is still possible for somebody to acquire the right of way. This might be an answer if the question were whether the road had been put in such condition that it is possible, by some new organization, and some new proceedings hereafter, to complete it for use. But the question is not whether the road can be so completed, but whether it has been so completed as to meet the requirement of the condition precedent incorporated into the resolution whereby the gratuity was granted. As already suggested, we do not understand it to be claimed that the road can be regarded as completed for use, unless it can be held that the right of way has been acquired. Such a position must certainly be untenable. Nobody would claim that a failure to lay the track for any part of the distance would not be a failure to complete the road for use; and if any authority were needed for so plain a proposition as that, it is furnished by the case of Hodgman v. Chicago  St. Paul R'y Co., 20 Minn. 59 , et seq. How does the laying down of a few iron rails compare in importance with the acquisition of the land on which to lay them? One requires simply a little manual labor, and the expense of procuring it; while the other requires the exercise of the highest prerogative of a sovereign state, &#8212; the right to take private property for a public use without the consent of the owner, by making him compensation therefor.\n\nWe say this railroad was not completed for use December 1, 1878; that it was not completed for use at the date of the writ, and is not so completed now, for the reason that neither the corporation nor these plaintiffs in interest have got the right of way. And we insist upon this as a fatal failure of performance of the condition precedent upon which the gratuity was voted, and therefore as a full answer and an insuperable bar to the plaintiffs' suit.\n\nIII. By a right construction of the resolution, it was made a condition precedent that the road should be completed for use on or before December 1, 1878. 1. That all the parties interested so regarded it is sufficiently shown by the report, and was much more fully shown at the trial. The Dawe \nBonnallie contract\nshowed it. The enormous struggle to get the rails strung out over the ground before that time, the work being pressed by the plaintiffs in interest nights, days, and Sundays to accomplish that end; the ridiculous farce of pretending to operate the road a few weeks in the winter following, with one old engine, and one car in one end of which passengers were invited to ride while their baggage occupied the other, both borrowed of the Nashua  Lowell Railroad; without hand-cars or gravel trains; and when the condition of the road-bed was such as is described in the report (very mildly described there, as we must say); the examination of the road, made by accomplished and disinterested experts employed by Keene, December 5 and 6, &#8212; all this shows unmistakably how the matter was then understood by all the parties interested. We contend that here was a contemporaneous practical construction of the contract by the parties, which ought to have great weight with the court. Contemporanea expositio est fortissima in leqe. 2. This is the fair meaning of the resolution, when read in the light of the circumstances under which it was passed. The vote of the people contained a proviso in these words: \"Provided that no part of said sum shall be expended until the city councils of said Keene shall have satisfactory evidence that said road shall be completed between said Greenfield and Keene in a reasonable time thereafter.\" The city councils distinctly declare that their resolution is passed \"to carry out the popular will, as expressed by the legal voters of the city of Keene, by a majority exceeding a two-thirds vote, at a legal meeting held on the 7th day of November, A. D. 1874.\" The popular will, as expressed by the vote, was clear and unequivocal, that the councils should, upon satisfactory evidence, fix the reasonable time within which the road should be completed. Did the city councils do this, or did they, in plain violation of the instructions by which they profess to be governed, leave the important matter of time wholly at large, and bind the people, against their expressed will, to pay whenever the road should be completed at any indefinite future time?\n\nIn construing the resolution, the court will put themselves as near as may be in the position of the city councils, and, taking into consideration all the circumstances under which their action was had, say what they meant by the language they used. And if the resolution is capable of a construction that shall render the body of it consistent rather than inconsistent with their purpose and intention, expressly declared in the preamble, that construction will be adopted. Plain men, and very acute business men, on reading the resolution, never seem to have misconstrued its purport, or entertained a doubt but that the provision as to time applied as well to the matter of completion as to the furnishing of guaranty for completion. And that is the way the resolution reads. The road was to be completed, or satisfactory guaranties given that it should be completed, on or before December 1, 1878.\nThe provision as to payment upon furnishing guaranty was inserted to encourage the speedy and vigorous prosecution of the work. No matter how soon the guaranty might be furnished, Keene would then make and deliver the bonds. That such guaranty and prepayment were expected seems to be fair]y inferable from the resolution; for the gratuity was voted to \"aid in the construction\" of the road. No guaranty was given. The construction contended for by the plaintiffs does violence to the declared purpose of the councils in passing it, putting them in the position of disregarding and disobeying the popular will which they say it is their intention to carry out, while it leads, at the same time, to the very improbable result that the city councils would appropriate this large sum of money to aid in building a railroad without any provision whatever as to the time within which it should be built. It is, moreover, so nice that nobody ever discovered it until the ingenuity of the very acute lawyers of the plaintiffs was brought to bear upon it. And even after the discovery it would be lost again, in the plain, ordinary meaning of the words, but for an exercise of the same ingenuity in keeping it in sight. We submit that the fair import of the language in which the whole provision, read together, is expressed, is what we claim, namely, that it must be completed, or a guaranty furnished that it should be completed, by December 1, 1878; and that this construction is fortified and made impregnable, first, by the contemporaneous construction alluded to, and secondly, by the circumstances under which it was passed, the expressed purpose and intent in passing it, and the object had in view by its passage.\n\nIV. Does the report show that the road was \"completed for use\" on or before December 1, 1878? That is, Is the finding as to its condition at that time equivalent to a finding that it was then completed for use within the meaning of the resolution? We say No. A word of comment on what really appears in the case may be necessary to show the court how the question as to the construction of the phrase \"completed for use\" is presented at this time for consideration. At the hearing, of course neither party knew what might be the view of the referees on this point. The defendants, from the beginning to the end of the hearing, insisted that the report should contain such specific findings of fact as would fairly present all questions of law involved to the court. And in this view they repeatedly informed the referees and counsel for plaintiffs that they abstained from wasting time by the discussion of legal questions. Among the legal questions supposed to be involved was the true construction of the resolution with reference to the words \"completed for use.\" The position of the defendants was broadly and clearly stated in the opening, and repeated as often as there was occasion, that the words \"for use\" did not diminish the legal effect of the word \"completed\" so as to make the expression completed for use mean less than completed; that\nif those words had any qualifying effect, it was to enlarge rather than diminish the requirement. To show what the defendants claim now, and as showing at the same time what was claimed by them at the hearing, we shall quote verbatim from notes prepared during the trial, and read in full in the course of the final argument to the referees. We said then, and say now, \"When a railroad may be fairly said to be completed for use is doubtless a pretty broad question, and perhaps in many cases not unattended with difficulty. It requires the exercise of broad and comprehensive judgment, &#8212; practical common-sense. It cannot be determined by any one single narrow rule, ordinarily. If there is a piece of road, long or short, not built, that would seem to be conclusive. See Minnesota case. So it would seem, for a like and equally strong reason, that if there is a piece of road over which the corporation have not acquired right to run &#8212; but that is a question of law in this case. But when something has been done to the earth by way of preparing it for a track, and the track has been strung out, then there becomes the semblance of a railroad, and more chance for questions. Cases of this kind may be so extreme that we should not doubt or hesitate much: as, for example, the condition of this so called railroad December 1, 1878. Then it may approach what you might call completion from a long ways off, until you get near. At first the question is easy; at last it grows more difficult. Is there any rule? I say No, none except sound judgment and common-sense. What elements must a railroad `completed for use' possess? What do the words `completed for use' necessarily imply? Certainly the idea of safety in its use is included. That is perhaps the first idea that occurs to us. But is the idea of safety in use any more controlling than some other qualities? Some things perish with the using. Is a railroad a thing of that kind? Certainly the idea of permanence in the existence and usefulness of a railroad is included in the idea of its completion for use. It is not possible to dissociate the idea of permanence in the use from the idea of completion for use. What would you say of a house, completed for use, when it was completed to that extent only that you might, with extraordinary care, struggle through one winter in it without its falling down upon your head or letting in the storms so as to drive you out, but which had to be reconstructed in substantial parts, and largely added to by you afterwards, in order to be habitable at all? Take a ship completed for use, that by dint of most careful management is made to perform a single voyage and then has to be laid up, abandoned forever, without substantial parts omitted in the construction being supplied: take a machine, designed to last and to be used for many years, that perishes with the using in three months: is or is not the idea of permanence involved and necessarily included in the term completed for use as applied to a railroad? As to economy in use, that is included in what I have said about permanence. Can a thing designed to be used,\nand designed to last in such use, be said to be completed for use when it is so faulty, so far from being finished, that it cannot be used as such things are used, and as a railroad is designed to be used, without self-destruction?\" The plaintiffs, on the other hand, contended that the words completed for use would be answered by a condition much less complete &#8212; further from perfection &#8212; than would answer the single word \"completed;\" that the words \"for use\" in some incomprehensible way emasculated the word \"completed,\" so that a string of iron rails over which it was possible to get an engine and single car, even though few trips were or could be made without derailment, and the performance was attended with infinite perils, might properly be held to be a railroad \"completed for use\" because it was in fact used.\n\nThe counsel for Keene, during the trial, when the same cases were brought to the attention of the referees which are now quoted from in the argument, repeatedly acquiesced in all then said, and repeatedly observed that they would be content to take the lowest standard set up by any respectable judge or expert, as shown in those cases or elsewhere, as to what would constitute a completed new railroad. And in order that there might be no misapprehension and no slip on this important point, the claim was reduced to writing, and twice read, in haec verba, during the closing argument. Look at it a moment: \"To meet the conditions of this resolution, the road must be completed for use, not partially completed, so that the work of completion may be carried on and finished alongside a partial and precarious use for traffic. We do not mean, made to be a perfect railroad. No road probably was ever completed in that sense; but we claim that it must be in a condition such that a fair man, of sound judgment and practical common-sense, one experienced in such things and having no interest in the result, would say it is a completed road, ready for use in the way railroads are ordinarily used for public traffic, the carrying of freight and passengers.\" At the hearing it did not occur to the counsel for Keene that the finding would be anything else than that the road was or was not completed for use at the several times when the question of completion might be material. But the referees did not find upon that question one way or the other, as regarded the condition of the road December 1, 1878. The finding of the majority is not that the road was or that it was not completed for use at that time, but that it was \"constructed,\" and was reasonably safe, c. What, then, is the true position of this question, as now presented by the report?\n\nAt first sight it would seem that the two findings could not possibly stand together. It would seem that a railroad that is \"reasonably safe, fit, and convenient for public use and accommodation\" must be in such condition \"that a fair man of sound judgment and practical common-sense, one experienced in such things and having no interest in the result, would say it is a completed road,\nready for use in the way railroads are ordinarily used for public traffic, the carrying of freight and passengers.\" The plaintiffs' counsel will have it that the finding of the majority is equivalent to a finding that the road was completed for use December 1, 1878 when they all say it was in such condition that a fair man, c., would say it was not a completed road, ready for use, c. Manifestly this argument convicts the majority of a degree of unfitness for the duty they undertook to perform, which we do not care to characterize in the only words that would fittingly describe it. Be it noted, that we do not argue or charge that the majority of this board were not fair men, or that they lacked in judgment and practical common-sense, or that they had any interest or anything equivalent to an interest in the result. But what we do argue is, that there is no escape from the position in which the plaintiffs' argument leaves them except this, that the added words \"as new railroads are ordinarily used in similar localities\" were intended to have an exceedingly large qualifying effect on those which precede &#8212; so large, indeed, that the conclusion is inevitable that their whole finding, taken together, falls very far short. of a finding that the road was completed for use December 1, 1878.\n\nThe simple truth is, however, as already stated, that the majority did not find, or intend to find, or to be understood as finding, that the road was completed for use December 1, 1878, or anything like it, &#8212; although the language they use, if it came from any other source, might possibly lead one to think it was intended to give a first impression as to its meaning which a more careful study shows it will not bear.\n\nWhat they say as to its construction and fitness for use at that time is qualified by the phrase \"as new railroads are ordinarily used in similar localities,\" and qualified to such an extent that they all agree the condition of the road was not up to the very moderate and reasonable standard claimed by the defendants. We complain of the use of this phrase by the majority. It is not in the resolution.\n\nThe phrase is very vague, loose, indefinite. It gives the court no sure ground upon which it can possibly say that the road was completed for use within the meaning of the resolution. It is certain that the referees, in their own minds, attached such meaning to it by way of qualifying the preceding part of the sentence, that they found a road fit for use in that way, which they say a fair and competent man would say was not completed ready for use. Now it is upon this finding of the referees that the plaintiffs ask the court to adjudge that this railroad was completed for use December 1, 1878. Will the court give to the qualifying words used by the referees the force and meaning and effect which it is self-evident the referees themselves gave to them? If that be done, but one result is possible; for the court can never hold, as we confidently believe, that a railroad which is not so far completed that a fair, intelligent,\nexperienced, disinterested man would say it is a completed road, ready for use in the way railroads are ordinarily used for public traffic, is completed for use within any fair meaning and intent of this municipal resolution. Is a railroad running through an agricultural country, as this does (and the court will take notice of the geography of the state), completed for use when it is not fenced? Fencing the road is a thing required by law. Gen. St., c. 148, s. 1. In giving construction to the resolution of this public, municipal corporation, is not this public law of the state to be considered? How can it be said that a railroad is completed for use when an important provision of the law, enacted to secure a reasonable degree of safety in its operation, has not been complied with? But, aside from the statute, it seems to us impossible to hold that a railroad is completed for use before it is fenced. An accident occasioned by running into a herd of cattle that have strayed upon the track may be just as serious in its consequences as one occasioned by running upon any other obstruction. And the defect which is likely to result in such an obstruction is just as much a lack of completion, as a defect from which boulders are likely to fall upon the track from the perpendicular walls of the cuts.\n\nFurther, we say that if it were possible to hold that the standard claimed by the defendants was too high, the facts reported show that the standard adopted by the referees was very much too low &#8212; that is, too low if we assume, as the plaintiffs do, that the whole report taken together shows a finding that the road was completed for use December 1, 1878. Look at the condition of the road-bed, the cuts, the embankments, the trestles, the settling of the track at the approaches to the trestles, its want of alignment, the want of depots and equipment; consider also how its condition is illustrated by the farcical attempt to run it for a few weeks, &#8212; and we submit that enough appears to satisfy the impartial mind that the road was not completed for use. Surely enough appears to show that it was not in fact used during that winter without infinite peril as well to those who undertook to operate it as to the few who trusted their bodies or their property to be carried over it, as it could not be and was not used for a day without destruction and loss.\n\nHersey  Abbott, for the defendants. I. By the terms of the resolution of the city councils, the road was to be completed for use by December 1, 1878. Completion by that time is a condition precedent, to be absolutely and strictly performed by the plaintiff corporation before the defendants can become liable.\n\nII. The time was essential. No completion subsequent to December 1, 1878, can entitle the plaintiffs to recover, and the doctrine of reasonable time does not apply.\n\nIII. The road was not \"completed for use,\" within the meaning\nof the vote of the city councils, on or before December 1, 1878, as is shown by the findings of the referees.\n\nThe first and second propositions are true, because, &#8212; (1) The grammar of the vote demands such a construction. The words \"on or before the first day of December, A. D. 1878,\" refer to the words \"completed for use\" as well as to the guaranty of such completion. The comma after \"Keene\" is of no significance, and will not be considered by the court in construing the vote. (2) Because they express the intention of the parties. It is obvious that it is not enough in every instance to ascertain the meaning of the parties. It is, however, always true that this is of the utmost importance, and often sufficient to determine the construction. It is not always sufficient, because the court cannot always construe an instrument to mean that which the parties to it meant. But having ascertained in some manner the real meaning of the parties the court will construe any legal instrument according to that intention, provided it can do so without violence to the rules of language or law. The court has the right to consider, in order to ascertain the intention, the situation of the parties, and the subject-matter of the instrument.\n\nBriefly, the situation of the parties was as follows: The company received its charter July 16, 1864, and for ten years had delayed to build the road, which was to connect Keene with the central portion of the state; for ten years had been endeavoring to unlock the treasury of the defendant city; until, at last, wearied by its importunity, a few hundred of her nearly two thousand voters undertook to bind Keene to pay this gratuity on certain conditions, one of which fixed the time within which the road should be completed. \"We are tired of waiting; you evidently cannot build this road without money. However, if you will complete a rail road by December 1, 1878, that will give to us the benefits which we desire, we will pay you this gratuity.\"What could be more natural and reasonable than this evident desire of Keene's voters to insure the speedy completion of this thoroughfare? It is true, they erred in supposing the plaintiffs could not do considerable work upon the road without money, as the sequel has shown. But because they so supposed, they committed the more egregious error of voting the gratuity at all. But in the midst of their wildest enthusiasm, they intended to fix, and did fix, what ought to be their bulwark &#8212; the time within which the road should be built. But it may be said that this vote of the people, which we admit is not of binding force, has nothing to do with the case. But it does show; when taken in connection with the vote of the councils, the intention of the city. The meaning of the popular vote was, that the city councils should, before any money was paid, have \"satisfactory evidence\" that the road should be \"completed\" in a \"reasonable time\" from said vote. The councils explained that such \"satisfactory evidence\" should consist either of a road \"completed\nfor use,\" or a \"satisfactory guaranty from responsible persons that it should be so completed,\" and such \"reasonable time\" should expire by December 1, 1878. Both votes were then notified to the plaintiffs, who, thus acting with a full knowledge of the intention and meaning of the resolution of grant, accepted the proposition in it conveyed. Both parties thus exercised their legal right, and fixed upon the time within which the road must be completed, by their express and intelligent acts, thereby making time of the essence of the proposition, a condition precedent from which must flow all the legal consequences of such conditions, and thereby taking from the court, as they had a right to do, the power to consider any question as to reasonable time, but leaving it to construe the instrument and find its meaning.\n\nThe city could not reasonably demand a guaranty for the completion of the road before the time of completion contemplated by the resolution and understood by the parties in case no guaranty were given. The subsequent acts of the parties show that this was their intention, and the meaning of the resolution. The plaintiffs acted upon that understanding, as is shown by (1) their various contracts, all demanding completion by that date; (2) the great efforts made under the Dawe  Bonnallie contract to complete the road by that date. We claim it is fair to infer that this contract was made for the distinct purpose of fulfilling the condition expressed in the resolution, and to carry out the original intention of the parties. By this contract, and by the singular zeal manifested at the last in the endeavor to run a train over the iron by December 1, 1878, Keene believed, and had a right to believe, that the plaintiffs regarded time as essential. Keene was thereby confirmed in her construction of the vote, and was led to refuse payment of the gratuity, and so put to the great expense of this trial. (3) The running of the trains on that date, although the road was in such a dilapidated, dangerous, and incomplete condition as the case shows it to have been. (4) The demand made upon the city at that time. (5) By the allegations in the writ and the demand of interest from that time. The defendants acted upon that understanding, as is shown by their steady refusal to pay this gratuity because the road was not then completed for use.\n\nThe doctrine of reasonable time has been applied only in cases of contract where the defendant has opportunity to recoup the damages suffered by delay. This resolution has not sufficient elements of a contract to give Keene this right. It offers a gratuity which is wholly due if the conditions precedent have been fulfilled. Therefore the application of the doctrine becomes unjust.\n\nThe cases cited by the plaintiffs are all cases of contract of purchase and sale, and the doctrine of reasonable time was reasonably applied. In this case, Keene has no remedy for any damages she may have suffered, and the doctrine does not apply.\n\n(6) Because this construction is natural and reasonable. It is the best construction, because it is that which is made by viewing the subject-matter of the contract as the mass of mankind would view it; for (2 Par. Con. 501) \"it may be safely assumed that such was the aspect in which the parties themselves viewed it. A result thus obtained is exactly what is obtained from the cardinal rule of intention.\" The whole contract must be considered in determining the meaning of any of its parts. If the time of completion without guaranty be obscure, then the time of completion with guaranty, as fixed by the parties, may be used to determine the time of completion intended in case no guaranty were given.\n\nThe alternative finding of the referees makes it the duty of the court to ascertain the correct standard of \"completion for use\" contemplated by the vote of the city councils, and involves the legal construction of the words \"completed for use.\" The plaintiffs say these words are \"those of the city, and not of the railroad company, and are therefore to be construed strictly against the former and liberally towards the latter.\" We suppose this statement is founded upon the maxim \"Verba ambigua,\" etc. That maxim only applies when the words of the instrument are ambiguous, and is not to be applied until other rules fail and the intention of the parties is not clear. The intention rules in every case when it appears, and the words \"completed for use,\" although those of the defendant city, are not to be construed strictly against it if the intention appear otherwise, but justly and in such a way as to carry out the intention. They are not to be construed against the city because they may bear such construction, when another intention appears. Indeed, they are not entirely the words of the city, because the plaintiffs adopted them and made them their own when they accepted the proposition of the city before commencing the construction of the road.\n\nIn construing the words \"completed for use,\" in order to ascertain the correct standard of completion required, the intention of the parties should govern, provided it can do so without violence to the rules of language or law. The standard of completion set up by the vote of the city councils required such a completion as would be beneficial to the city. Such a standard must necessarily and reasonably have been contemplated by the city. Any other standard would have rendered the vote illegal, because the city could not legally have voted away the money of its citizens for that which would confer no benefit upon them. The city could be benefited only by the safe, economical, and permanent operation of the road. For such an operation the gratuity was offered. The completion contemplated was not a temporary completion, nor a completion for further construction, such as the report finds. Such a completion could bring no benefit to the city, and could not reasonably have been contemplated. Nor could it have achieved the object which both parties had in view, to wit, quick and permanent\ncommunication between Manchester and Keene. Nor did it achieve that object, because the road ceased to be operated within three months after December 1, 1878, by reason of its bad condition. The object for which the city offered its money must be kept in view, and must bear its weight in the construction of the resolution. A road which should be only so far completed as to be capable of operation for a day, a month, or a year only, could not have been contemplated by the city. The object was a highway of transportation for freight and passengers, one capable of safe use and of economical use; for thus only could the city derive those permanent benefits it had a right to expect and did expect when it passed the resolution, and without providing for which the vote would have been illegal, and of no binding force in any event. These words \"completed for use,\" meaning the same or more than the word \"completed\" alone would mean, were designed to protect the city against just such a standard of completion as the plaintiffs claim and the referees have applied. Completion does not mean perfection. If it did, then the words \"for use\" would restrict. Now they may enlarge, and we claim they do enlarge. The city councils added these words to the word \"completed,\" as used in the popular vote, for the express purpose of compelling the plaintiffs to bestow upon the city those benefits which could only arise from permanent and continuous use. The incentive to the vote was just such a use &#8212; was a railroad so completed that it could be used as other roads, old and new, are used, and not a railroad whose scattering \"sands of life\" ran out, and whose numerous boulders of death ran in, within three months after its alleged \"opening.\" The word \"use\" carries with it the impression of permanency and continuous employment (Webster's Dict.). Further, this was a gratuity, and not a contract whereby Keene was to obtain stock or bonds or anything by which it could exercise any control of the road in the future. Therefore the resolution should be construed liberally in favor of the defendants. But as the incentive to the resolution and the reason of its enactment was the continuous use of the road, standing in the place of the quid pro quo of a contract, said use should have a controlling effect upon the construction of the resolution, and in ascertaining the legal standard of completion.\n\nA majority of the referees have found the road completed for use December 1, 1878, because it was reasonably safe, fit, and convenient for the public use and accommodation, as new railroads are ordinarily used in similar localities. They thereby adopted a standard of completion differing from that claimed by the defendants, as is shown by their alternative finding. The standard was incorrect, because the idea of permanent benefit to the city is entirely left out. A use of the road for a single day without disaster would, under this finding, render Keene liable. And in fact the referees undertake to find the defendants liable because the road was\nused without disaster for three months after December 1, 1878, notwithstanding it ceased to be operated by reason of its bad condition, &#8212; in other words, its non-completion, &#8212; and Keene was thereby deprived of any benefits whatever. The position taken by the plaintiffs, that Keene needed the road as much one or two years after December 1, 1878, as at that time, admits that the reasonably permanent use of the road was the thing demanded, and is inconsistent with the declaration that a road completed for some purposes only will satisfy the demand and requirements of the resolution. The referees had no right to use those vague and dangerous words \"as new railroads are ordinarily used in similar localities.\" Such a claim was not seriously made at the trial by the plaintiffs, nor did the defendants have the least notice that the referees would undertake to set up such a standard. We claim such a standard is incorrect. But if correct, then we are entitled to a further hearing on that point of the finding. What the referees meant by the words \"reasonably safe, fit, and convenient,\" etc., is to be found by their description of the road; &#8212; i. e., a reasonably safe, fit, and convenient road, is a road unfenced for 18 1/2 of its 29 1/2 miles in length, and requiring $8,600 to complete in this respect alone; is a road without terminal facilities, and requiring $1,900 to be expended in needed depots along the line; is a road with incomplete trestles, with track out of line and surface at approaches to trestles, with cuts steep, narrow, and without ditches, embankments so slack that a reasonable degree of economy would require, during the year from December 1, 1878, large additions, fills not up to grade, without sufficient ballast, with ties untamped, with some fills so narrow that the ties extended beyond the embankments, with the ends of the trestles settled and liable to settle, with trestles some of whose bents were out of plumb and line, with at least three trestles of a temporary character, with rocks and boulders in the banks of the cuts in such position that there was a probability of their coming down upon the track; is a road which was rendered impassable at various times, and finally closed against traffic, by material from the sides of the cuts and from the ditches crowding in upon the track; is a road on which cars were frequently derailed for reasons which the referees could not discover; is a road which had no right of way over 6,431 feet of its 29 1/2 miles &#8212; deficiencies the cost of supplying which would have amounted to the substantial sum of $20,000. This description means just the same thing in the report as the words \"reasonably safe, fit, and convenient,\" etc., and we claim that a road in that condition is not completed, nor completed for use; wherefore a road reasonably safe, fit, and convenient, etc., is not completed, nor completed for use. But if the court should find the standard correct, then we say the finding is not sustained by the facts reported concerning the condition of the road in detail; &#8212; i. e., the legal standard is not correctly applied to the facts; the facts were not required to be brought up\nto the standard, but the standard was accommodated to the facts &#8212; a matter which the court has ample power to revise.\n\nThe payment of land damages is a condition precedent to completion for use. The finding of a waiver by land-owners is unsupported by evidence. Even if the finding be justifiable, the referees neglected to find that there was a waiver December 1, 1878, as is evident from the grammar used in their finding. It is important to keep in mind that evidence concerning the condition of the road September 16, 1880, is not necessarily evidence of its condition December 1, 1878. Keene had no need to point out specific defects, nor to express dissatisfaction. The plaintiffs had a condition to perform, and they knew the requirements of that condition, as is shown by the Dawe  Bonnallie contract. And as they offered a railroad much inferior to the railroad called for by that contract, they knew that the condition had not been met, and so substantially admitted in the declaration, to which attention is called. This claim by the plaintiffs is a weak and puerile attempt to shift upon Keene the responsibility of radical deficiencies in construction, which the company knew existed, and for which they alone were to blame. Rather was it the duty of the city councils, for the protection of the citizens of Keene, to refuse payment of the gratuity, until, by the lapse of a reasonable time, they could have \"satisfactory evidence\" that the permanent and continuous use of the railroad was assured. It was a matter of business, and not of charity. Keene could know whether the condition had been met only by delay. Subsequent events justified that delay. Long before a reasonable time of delay had elapsed, the road ceased to be used by reason of its bad condition caused by defective construction and consequent inability to resist the laws of nature, which railroads, in order to be railroads, have to resist; and if Keene had paid the gratuity in December, 1878, there is nothing to show that the road would ever have been in a condition different from its condition in March, 1879. Keene's only protection was the condition fulfilled, and she had a right to delay payment until she knew whether the condition had been fulfilled.\n\nBatchelder  Faulkner, on the same side.", "caseName": "Manchester & Keene Railroad v.

Facts found by referees. At a legal meeting of the voters of the city of Keene, November 7, 1874, it was voted, by a majority exceeding two thirds, as follows: That the city of Keene raise by loan, for a term not exceeding thirty years, a sum equal to three per cent. of the last valuation of said city as made by the assessors, and appropriate the same as a gratuity to the Manchester  Keene Railroad, to aid in the construction of that part of said road lying between Greenfield and Keene, provided that no part of said sum shall be expended until the city councils of said Keene shall have satisfactory evidence that said road shall be completed between said Greenfield and Keene in a reasonable time thereafter, and provided further, that the bonds issued shall bear interest at six per cent., with coupons payable semi-annually.

The record does not show either that the last vote was adopted by a two-thirds vote, or that any one opposed its adoption. On the same day the clerk of the meeting furnished a certified copy of the first vote to the city councils of Keene.\n\nDecember 11, 1874, the city councils of Keene, by a majority exceeding two thirds in each branch, passed the following joint resolution, which was approved by the mayor on the same day:\n\n\"City of Keene, in the year of our Lord, 1874: A joint resolution to carry out the popular will, as expressed by the legal voters of the city of Keene. by a majority exceeding a two-thirds vote, at a legal meeting held on the 7th day of November A. D. 1874.\n\n\"Resolved, by the city councils of the city of Keene as follows: That a sum equal to three per cent. on the last property valuation of the city of Keene, as made by the assessors thereof, be raised and appropriated as a gratuity to the Manchester  Keene Railroad Company, to aid in the construction of that part of said railroad which shall be laid out and established between Greenfield in the county of Hillsborough, and the terminus at the city of Keene, and such sum is hereby appropriated for that purpose, provided that no part of said sum shall be paid in money of bonds, or be liable to be paid as aforesaid, to said railroad company, until said road shall be completed for use from said Greenfield to said Keene, or until the city councils shall have satisfactory guaranty from responsible persons that it will be so completed on or before the first day of December, A. D. 1878, and the councils shall so determine by a joint resolution. And the said city hereby reserves to itself the right to pay said gratuity in bonds of the said city, like as hereinafter described, to be taken by said railroad at par, in discharge of this obligation.\n\n\"Resolved further, That in order to meet the foregoing obligation\nof the city, the bonds of the city, in sums of one hundred, two hundred, three hundred, five hundred, and one thousand dollars, respectively signed by the mayor and president of the council, and countersigned by the treasurer of the city, shall be issued at par, with interest coupons attached at the rate of six per cent. per annum, payable semi-annually, the principal in said bonds to be made payable at such respective times that the whole amount of the sum so appropriated shall be payable in not more than thirty years, and at least three per cent. of said sum be payable annually, commencing with the third year after the issuing of said bonds.\"\n\nSaid votes of said city were simultaneously notified to the plaintiff company. The directors of said company voted, December 28, 1874, to accept the gratuity voted to that railroad by the city of Keene; and also voted that the treasurer be instructed to notify the city councils of Keene that the board of directors of the Manchester Keene Railroad have this day accepted the vote passed by them, granting three per cent. of the valuation as made by the assessors thereof for the year 1874, as a gratuity to the Manchester Keene Railroad. Notice of such acceptance was, on January 2, 1875, given to the city councils.\n\nApril 29, 1876, the plaintiffs made a contract with Richardson \nGallison for the construction of the road. They worked on the entire line under the contract from May to September, 1876, when they failed, and the contract was declared forfeited in October, 1876. The road was completed from Greenfield to Hancock Centre, a distance of about eight miles, between May, 1877, and January, 1878, under a contract with John H. Dawe. April 4, 1878, the plaintiffs contracted with Dawe  Bonnallie for the construction of the road from Hancock Centre to its terminus in Keene, a distance of about 22 miles, to be completed on or before December 1, 1878, for $683,196.31, of which sum $128,951.58 was payable by an assignment of the Keene gratuity, $250,000 in stock of the plaintiff company, and $230,000 in bonds of the plaintiff company, and the balance in sundry other items equal to cash. On the same day (April 4, 1878), as provided by the contract, the plaintiffs assigned the gratuity, voted by the defendants, to Dawe  Bonnallie, and the assignment was filed in the clerk's office of the city of Keene, April 5, 1878. Between April 4, 1878, and October 10, 1878, Dawe  Bonnallie assigned to S.W. Hale, Henry Colony, John Y. Scruton, Wm. P. Frye, A.  W. Dickinson, and A. W. Eames, the whole of said gratuity as collateral security. The assignments were seasonably filed in the office of the city clerk of Keene, and this suit is prosecuted by the assignees, and the plaintiff corporation has now no substantial interest in said gratuity or in this suit. Dawe  Bonnallie proceeded to construct the road, under said contract, relying upon said gratuity as part payment. The rails were connected from Greenfield to the terminus in Keene, and a trial train run over the whole of the same November 30, 1878.\n\nA majority of the referees find that on the first day of December, 1878, the railroad of the plaintiff corporation was constructed from Greenfield to the terminus in Keene, and was reasonably safe, fit, and convenient for the public use and accommodation, as new railroads are ordinarily used in similar localities. Upon the foregoing facts a majority of the referees find that the railroad from Greenfield to the terminus in Keene was completed for use on the first day of December, 1878.\n\nThe defendants claimed that the words \"completed for use\" in the resolution of the city councils have the same force and meaning as the simple word \"completed\" would have, and requested the referees to report the facts bearing upon that construction, which are as follows:\n\nDecember 1, 1878, there were only about eleven miles of fencing on the line of the road, and it was estimated that it required about $8,600 to finish the fencing. There was no depot at West Harrisville, and only a rough board structure at Harrisville. The cost of building suitable depots at said places was estimated at $1,900. There were no turn-tables, or other terminal facilities other than those used, which belonged to connecting roads. A certain amount of timber was required in the trestles to complete the same according to the original plan. The track was somewhat out of line and surface at some of the approaches to the trestles. Some cuts were one to one, and some a little steeper. Many fills were not up to grade, and the banks were generally slack. Land damages to the amount of $881, representing 6,431 lineal feet out of 29 1/2 miles, were and still are unpaid, but were all assessed, and the amounts assessed tendered in all cases except one, and in that case the damages were agreed on, and a partial payment made. No land-owner has attempted or threatened to disturb the possession of the plaintiffs, or objected to the plaintiffs' occupying the land taken for the road. No part of the above unpaid damages has been deposited with the state treasurer. There was no evidence of express waiver, but from these facts the referees find that the unpaid land-owners have waived their right to dispossess the plaintiffs. Many of the cuts were left narrow, and without ditches. For considerable distances there was no ballast between the ties, and at some points the ties were not tamped, and at some few places the ends of the ties extended beyond the embankments. The ends of the trestles where they joined the embankments had settled, and were liable to settle more. In one place, the new embankment had crowded the trestle, so that some of the bents were out of plumb and line. There are three trestles designed hereafter to be filled with earth, and other trestles which may hereafter be so filled. The referees find that the sum of $20,000 would have made good all of said deficiencies, including fences and depots, and exclusive of filling the trestles; and the referees find that the construction of said trestles in place of embankments of\nearth was not a deficiency. If the defendants' contention as to the construction to be given to the words \"completed for use\" is right, then the referees find that said railroad was not completed for use on the first day of December, 1878.\n\nDecember 5, 1878, the plaintiff company notified the defendants that the road was completed for use, and demanded payment of the gratuity voted as aforesaid. January 2, 1879, the city councils of Keene, in reply to said demand, directed the mayor to reply that the councils \"believe the road was not completed on the first day of December, 1878, and that it is not now completed; and for this, and other reasons, we must therefore respectfully decline to grant the request for a gratuity.\" This vote was approved by the mayor, and was notified to the plaintiff company, but it does not appear by the records that it passed by a two-thirds vote, or that any one dissented.\n\nIn the month of December, 1878, the plaintiff company and Dawe  Bonnallie became insolvent, and have so remained. The road was operated from December 1, 1878, until the end of February, 1879. During that time the road was allowed to deteriorate, and was not operated from March 1, 1879, until September 1, 1880. From September 1, 1880, it has been operated by the trustees appointed by the court in August, 1880. From December 1, 1878, to March 1, 1879, the receipts from operating the road were about $1,900, and the expenses about $3,000. From September 1, 1880, to March 1, 1881, the receipts from operating the road were $10,240.02, and the expenses were $16,859.59. The evidence as to the receipts and expenditures from September 1, 1880, to March 1, 1881, was put in by the defendants, and afterwards the plaintiffs proved, and the referees find, that the road is not so run as to develop its business. The plaintiff corporation expended about $7,000 in 1879, in putting the road in order. In 1880, and prior to the reopening of the road, the plaintiffs in interest expended for masonry, ballasting, surfacing, track, etc., about $14,000; bridges and trestles, about $7,000; fencing, about $4,800; depots and buildings, about $1,500. Miscellaneous bills, including engineer, about $2,200.\n\nThe referees find that on the first day of September, 1880, said railroad from Greenfield to its terminus in Keene was completed for use, giving to the words \"completed for use\" the force and meaning contended for by the defendants, and that said road was so completed within a reasonable time from December 11, 1874. In determining what would be a reasonable time, the referees have considered only such facts as were known to both parties December 11, 1874, and the facts proved in this case without objection, and have held that a reasonable time included not only time for the actual labor of constructing the road, but the time which, at the date of the vote of the gratuity, the parties might have reasonably presumed would be needed to obtain funds to construct the road.\n\nThe road is now being operated by the trustees appointed by the court in August, 1880, who are indemnified by the plaintiffs in interest. The corporation has no money or other funds wherewith to pay land damages or procure rolling-stock, and has no rolling-stock or equipment except road-masters' equipment, and has no terminal facilities or turn-tables, but use those of connecting roads. At no time during the progress of the work has the city of Keene given the plaintiff corporation, or the plaintiffs in interest, any notice except as already stated, or by any corporate action expressed any dissatisfaction with the progress of the work. September 15, 1880, the plaintiff company, Dawe  Bonnallie, and the plaintiffs in interest, made a new request of the defendants for payment of the gratuity, with interest from December 5, 1878. The amount of the gratuity is $128,951.58.\n\nThe referees find that the defendants did promise the plaintiffs in manner and form as the plaintiffs have declared against them, and do award that the plaintiffs recover of the defendants the sum of one hundred twenty-eight thousand nine hundred and fifty-one dollars and fifty-eight cents ($128,951.58) and interest from December 5, 1878, or from September 15, 1880, according as the court shall hold upon the foregoing facts.", "procedural_history": "", "scdb_id": "", "sibling_ids": [3553706], "source": "ZU", "status": "Published", "suitNature": "", "syllabus": ""}

{"absolute_url": "/opinion/3569691/state-v-lapage/", "attorney": "Lewis W. Clark, attorney-general (with whom were W. W. Flanders, solicitor, and C. P. Sanborn), for the State.\n\nThere were two questions for the jury: 1st, Was the defendant the person who killed the deceased? 2d, If he was the slayer, did he kill her in perpetrating or attempting to perpetrate rape? No exceptions were taken to the charge. Under an unexceptionable charge, and upon other testimony than that of Julienne Rousse, the jury have answered the first question in the affirmative.\n\nI. The only question of law raised by the bill of exceptions is, whether the evidence objected to is admissible for any purpose. Does this evidence have a legal tendency to show that the defendant killed the deceased, or that he intended to commit a rape upon her?\n\nThe burden was on the State to prove the first degree of murder. Unless the State proved that degree beyond all reasonable doubt, the defendant could not be found guilty of that degree. The degree was as distinct and separate a point to be proved by the State as the fact that there was such a person as Josie Langmaid, the fact that she is dead, the fact that she died a violent death the fact that her death was not accidental, the fact that she did not commit suicide, or the fact that the defendant is the person who killed her. In cases of this kind we are apt to lose sight of the wide gulf between the proved homicide, and the necessity of proving the degree of it. We are apt to take it for granted that such a homicide as this apparently was, was a murder of the first degree; that there is no need of any evidence on the question of degree, and that the jury will find the first degree if they find homicide. And when we infer the degree from the sex and age of the deceased, and the peculiar mutilation of her person, we are apt to confound the duties of court, counsel, and jury; to presume that the jury must draw the same inference that we draw, and to think that counsel need not offer, and that the court may safely reject all distinct and independent evidence on the question of degree. But counsel cannot argue here, and the court cannot hold, that as matter of fact the jury must have found the first degree from the evidence of sex, age, and mutilation. That is a question with which we here have nothing to do. The only question of law here is, whether the evidence objected to had any legal tendency to prove any material fact.\n\nThis evidence was cumulative, &#8212; that is, it tended to prove a fact or facts which other evidence also tended to prove. All evidence, except the first scintilla on every point, is cumulative; but all evidence except the first scintilla is not therefore incompetent.\n\nIf at the trial the court had believed that this evidence was superfluous, and was offered in bad faith for the purpose of prejudicing the jury improperly on some other points than those on which it was offered, or\nthat, on any other ground within the discretion of the courts it ought not to be received, the court would have exercised its discretionary power. But no cause for exercising that power appears here.\n\nHad the evidence a legal tendency to prove any fact put in issue by the defendant's plea? One fact thus put in issue was his killing the deceased. Another fact thus put in issue was his killing her, not accidentally, not in self-defence, not under any of the great variety of circumstances or for any of the numerous reasons that would make his homicidal act manslaughter or murder in the second degree, but in the commission of or the attempt to commit a rape, or under any other circumstances or for any other reasons that would make his homicidal act murder in the first degree. The State, asking a conviction, not for manslaughter, or murder in the second degree, were bound to satisfy not the court, but the jury, not only that the homicide was committed by the defendant, but also that the homicide was murder of the first degree; &#8212; and of this the State was bound to satisfy the jury beyond all reasonable doubt. The court could not instruct the jury that they were bound to find, upon the evidence received without objection, that the homicide was murder of the first degree; &#8212; for error in such instructions the judgment would be reversed. Without the evidence objected to the jury might not have been satisfied, beyond all reasonable doubt, that the deceased did not die suddenly of heart disease, or did not commit suicide, or was not accidentally killed by a carriage running over her, or by a random gun-shot. In either case the dead body might have been found and mangled by some person who was innocent of her death. The defendant or some other person might have insulted her, or committed an indecent assault upon her; and in the struggle that ensued the homicide might have been murdered in the second degree, or voluntary or involuntary manslaughter. The State, being bound to remove from the minds of the jury every reasonable doubt on these and all other possible points involved in the charge of murder in the first degree, had a right to introduce evidence on those points.\n\nSince the decision in Darling v. Westmoreland,  52 N.H. 401 ,  403 ,  405 , 406 , it cannot be necessary, in this state, to argue or to cite authorities to show that the evidence to prove several independent propositions or distinct facts may be of different kinds and drawn from different sources; and that the rule requiring evidence to be confined to the point in issue, excluding evidence of general character and disposition, and prohibiting the trial of collateral issues, is merely the rule that requires evidence to be relevant, and excludes what is irrelevant; and when such evidence is admitted, it is admitted not because it is evidence of character or disposition, or of such other transaction, but because the character, disposition, or transaction is relevant. Character, disposition, and certain innocent or criminal acts, not being the primary, express, and immediate subject of the issue, may be relevant, that is, may have a legal tendency to prove a material fact involved in the issue. And they may be irrelevant. And because they are often irrelevant, and therefore inadmissible in evidence, it is often said that there is a rule of law\nthat excludes evidence of other crimes than that charged, and evidence of a general disposition to commit the same kind of offence. But the books abound in cases that slow there neither is nor can be any such rule. What is often erroneously called a rule of that kind is merely the application to a particular case of the rule requiring evidence to be relevant. When certain evidence tends to prove the commission of another crime than that charged, or a general disposition to commit such or any other crime, the circumstance that the act or disposition, which the evidence tends directly to prove, is criminal, is wholly immaterial. The question is not whether it is criminal, but whether it is relevant &#8212; whether it has a legal tendency to prove, a fact material to the issue.\n\nAlthough evidence offered in support of an indictment for felony be proof of another felony, that circumstance does not render it inadmissible. If the evidence offered tends to prove a material fact, it is admissible, although it may also tend to prove the commission of another distinct and separate offence. Mason v. The State,  42 Ala. 532 ,  537 ; Kirkwood's Case, 1 Lewin C. C. 103; Com. v. Stearns, 10 Met. 256; Reg. v. Aston, 2 Russ. on Cr. 841, 4th ed.; 3 id., 286; Reg. v. Weeks, Leigh  Cave C. C. 18, 21.\n\n\"The principle is, that all the evidence admitted must be pertinent to the point in issue; but if it be pertinent to this points and tends to prove the crime alleged, it is not to be rejected, though it also tends to prove the commission of other crimes, or to establish collateral facts.\" Com. v. Choate,  105 Mass. 451 ,  458 . In Reg. v. Lewis, Arch Cr. Pl. (14th ed.) 486, Lord DENMAN \"could not conceive how the relevancy of the fact to the charge could be affected by its being the subject of another charge.\" Evidence of other crimes than the one charged is so frequently received on indictments for forgery and counterfeiting, and uttering forged or counterfeit papers or coins, that those classes of cases are sometimes erroneously spoken of as exceptions to the general rule of evidence. They are not exceptions. Evidence is received in all cases when it is relevant (unless it is rejected, on some ground of fact, by an exercise of judicial discretion) without reference to the question whether the facts proved are criminal or not. Its competency consists, not in the innocent character of the act which it tends to prove, but in the relevancy of that act to the issue. Evidence of other crimes is more frequently received in cases of forgery and counterfeiting than in other cases, not because those cases are exceptional in law, but because, in fact, such evidence is more frequently available in those than in other cases to prove a material fact. It is admitted to prove the guilty knowledge, the motive, or the intent, not because there is any exception or special rule of law applicable to proof of the defendant's knowledge, motive, or intent, but because his knowledge, motive, or intent is a material fact to be proved, like any other material fact, by relevant evidence.\n\nThe general rule of evidence that requires evidence to be relevant admits evidence that is relevant, and it is as applicable to murder as to passing counterfeit money.\n\nIn Rex v. Voke, R.  R. 531, it was held by all the judges, on the charge of shooting with intent to kill, that proof of shooting at the same persons at another time was competent to show that the shooting charged was not accidental. In Reg. v. Geering, 18 Law Journal Mag., cas. 215, the charge was against a wife for the murder of her husband by poison. Evidence of three of her sons being subsequently poisoned was received to show that her husband died of poison and that his death was not accidental. In Reg. v. Cotton, 12 Cox C. C. 400, the charge was against a mother for murdering her child by poison. Evidence was held admissible to prove that two other children of hers and a lodger in the house, had previously died of poison. In Reg. v. Garner  Wife, 3 F.  F. 681, the charge was the murder of Garner's mother by poison. His wife had lived in his family as a servant when his former wife died. His mother died of poison. Evidence was received to show that his first wife died of poison, and to show the circumstances of her death. Reg. v. Roder 12 Cox C. C. 630, on the trial of the defendant for murdering her infant by suffocation in bed evidence was received tending to allow the previous deaths of her other children at early ages. In Rex v. Clewes, 4 C.  P. 221, on a charge of murdering H., evidence was received to show that H. had been employed by the defendant to murder P. In State v. Watkins,  9 Conn. 47 , on a charge of murdering the defendant's wife, evidence was received to show the defendant in adulterous intercourse with another woman for some months before his wife's death Johnson v. State,  17 Ala. 618 ; Hall v. State.  40 Ala. 698 ; People v. Stout, 4 Parker Cr. 71. In Com. v. Ferrigan,  44 Pa. 386 , in a trial of murder, evidence was received to show an adulterous intercourse between the defendant and the wife of the deceased.\n\nAnd the general rule applies to the killing of horses as well as to murder. In Rex v. Mogg, 4 C.  P. 364, on a charge of administrating sulphuric acid to eight horses with intent to kill them, evidence of the defendant's administering it at different times was received to show his intent. And the same doctrine is held in all other classes of cases, as well as those relating to the destruction of life. In Reg. v. Dossett, 2 C. K. 306, on a charge of setting fire to a rick by firing a gun close to it on the twenty-ninth of March, evidence that the rick was also one fire on the twenty-eighth of March, and that the prisoner was then close to it, having a gun in his hand, was received to how that the fire on the twenty-ninth was not accidental. On the question of accident the evidence would have been relevant if it had related to another rick belonging to another person. On a charge of setting fire to the defendant's house, with intent to defraud an insurance company, evidence that the defendant had insured in other offices two other houses in which he had lived that were burned, and that he received the insurance money from the other companies, is relevant as tending to show that the fire in question was intended, and not accidental. Reg. v. Gray, 4 F. . F. 1102.\n\nThe question of accidental death in the present case was one upon\nwhich the state was bound to satisfy the jury beyond all reasonable doubt, and therefore one on which the State had a right to introduce evidence. Mere proof that the defendant's killed the deceased would be perfectly consistent with murder in the second degree, or manslaughter or the defendant's entire innocence. He might have killed her in self-defence, or accidentally and without fault on his part. The State, asking for a conviction of murder in the first degree was bound to prove beyond all reasonable doubt not only that he killed her, but also that the homicide was \"murder committed by poison, starving, torture, or other deliberate and premeditated killing, or committed in perpetrating or attempting to perpetrate arson, rape, robbery, or burglary.\"\n\nUnder an indictment for arson, evidence of two previous and abortive attempts to set fire to the same premises, though there was no evidence that they were made by the defendant, was admitted to slow that the last fire was not accidental. Reg. v. Bailey, 2 Cox C. C. 311. In Reg. v. Proud, Leigh  Cave C. C. 97, 101, the charge was embezzlement by the defendant as clerk, who made false entries in his book of the amounts by him received. It was held (by Pollock Wightman, Williams, Martin and Channell) that the book was evidence generally, that not only the false entries bearing directly upon the three charges in the indictment, but also other similar false entries, were competent evidence. Reg. v. Richardson, 2 F.  F. 343 was a charge of embezzlement against a clerk who made out weekly accounts of this payments. On three occasions within six months he entered the payments correctly, but, in adding them up, made the totals 21. greater than they were, and took credit for the larger amounts. These were the cases on which the indictment was founded. Evidence that, on a series of occasions before and afterwards, precisely similar errors had been made and advantage taken of by him was received to show that the errors in the three instances to which the indictments related were intentional and fraudulent, and not accidental. Com. v. Tuckerman, 10 Gray 173, 200, was a charge of embezzlement. The court say, &#8212; \"Where the intent of the accused party forms any part of the matter in issue, evidence may always be given of other acts not in issue, provided they tend to establish the intent imputed to him in committing the act.\" Com. v. Shepherd, 1 Allen 575, 581, was another case of embezzlement. It was held that evidence of another act of embezzlement by the defendant, during the same week, was competent on the question of intent. In Com. v. Eastman, 1 Cush. 189, 216, the defendants were indicted for obtaining goods of certain persons by false pretences. Evidence of the purchase of other goods from other persons was held competent on the question of criminal intent. Reg. v. Roebuck, Dearsly  Bell C. C. 24, was another case of false pretences. The false pretence was that a chain, pledged by the defendant to a pawnbroker, was silver. Evidence that the defendant a few days afterwards offered a similar claim to another pawnbroker was held admissible.\n\nRex v. Winkworth, 4 C.  P. 444, was a charge of robbery. The prosecutor\nwas induced by the defendants' advice to give money to a mob who came to his house, to get rid of them and prevent mischief. To show that the advice was fraudulent, and a mere mode of robbing the prosecutor, evidence was received to show that the same mob had demanded money at other houses when some of the defendants were present. Defrese et al. v. The State, 3 Heisk. 53, 62, was another indictment for robbery. Verdict, guilty of larceny of the prosecutor's watch, which was obtained by the defendant under the pretence of a bet. Evidence was held competent to show that the defendant had attempted to practice the same artifice on other persons and other occasions. The court say (p. 63), &#8212; \"As a general proposition of law, it is undoubtedly true that no distinct and substantive crime can be shown upon the trial. But this rule is better understood as it is given in the textbooks, that the facts proven should be strictly relevant to the particular charge.\" Upon the question whether the purchase of property from one person was fraudulent, evidence is admissible to slow that the purchaser fraudulently bought other property of other persons. Bradley v. Obear,  10 N.H. 477 ,  480 ; Hovey v. Grant,  52 N.H. 569 . And the same rule admits evidence of one fraudulent transaction to show a, fraudulent intent in another transaction, in criminal as well as in civil cases. State v. Johnson,  33 N.H. 441 ,  456 ,  457 . Reg. v. Bleasdale, 2 C.  K. 765, was a charge of stealing coal. The defendant was lessee of a coal mine, and from the shaft of the leased mine he had wrongfully cut into the adjoining premises, and taken coal during a period of more than four years from the coal fields of thirty or forty different owners. All this was held competent on the question of felonious intent in taking the coal of one person.\n\nIn an admirable brief of Attorney-General Train's, of Mass., in Com. v. McCarthy, Essex, November, 1875 (to which I am much indebted, and which I send to the chief justice), a few similar authorities are cited on evidence of guilty knowledge in receiving stolen goods, passing counterfeit coin, and uttering forged notes. The application of the rule in such cases is too common and familiar, and the authorities are too numerous, to justify counsel in dwelling at length on this branch of the subject. In Rex v. Balls, 1 Moody C. C. 470 (S.C. 7 C.  P. 429), on a trial for forging and uttering a note of the kingdom of Poland, on September 1, 1835, evidence was received to show that the defendant, on August 24, 1835, agreed to forge a thousand Austrian notes, and that in September, 1834, he had plates for printing Polish notes different from that which was the subject of the indictment, and caused five hundred notes to be printed from those plates. The case was reserved, and the judges held the evidence was admissible. Such evidence is competent, whether the possession or utterance be prior or subsequent, and whether the false documents, notes, or money, be of the same or a different description. Reg. v. Foster, Dearsly C. C. 456; Reg. v. Nisbett, 6 Cox C. C. 320; Reg. v. Salt, 3 F.  F. 834; Com. v. Price, 10 Gray 472.\n\nCom. v. Edgerly, 10 Allen 134, 186, 187, was a charge of having a\ncounterfeit bank bill with intent to pass it. It was held that evidence was admissible to  show that the defendant had and passed a different kind of counterfeit money at various times and places; and that he had made to a witness statements which amounted to an admission that he was a dealer in counterfeit money. \"It cannot be doubted,\" say the court, \"that a direct statement by the defendant, made previous to the transaction which forms the subject of the indictment, that he was accustomed to buy and sell counterfeit money,\" would be admissible. The fact of his being a professional counterfeiter or a common dealer in counterfeit money, was relevant to the particular charge of knowingly having a counterfeit bill with intent to pass it; and being relevant, it could be proved by other evidence as well as by his own statements.\n\nOn a trial for burglary, it is no valid objection to evidence, tending to show the burglarious intent of the defendant's act, that it proves another and distinct offence; but the intent with which he entered may be shown by proof of a felony committed in an adjoining store. Osborne v. People, 2 Parker C. R. 583; Phillips v. People, 57 Barb. 353. In Mason v. The state, 42 Ala. 532 ,  539 , evidence was held admissible to show that the prisoners had committed other burglaries than that charged. The court say, &#8212; \"The evidence tended to  show that there was a privity and community of design between the prisoners to commit offences of the character charged against them.\" \"Privity and community of design\" is a larger phrase than \"intent\" but it means the same thing. To show their intent, written articles of agreement, signed by the defendants, setting forth their intent of going into the burglary business, would be competent, And it would not be necessary that their agreement be reduced to writing. Their oral statements would be equally competent, as in the case of the dealer in counterfeit money. And the intent may be proved by other burglaries, as well as by written or oral statements; by acts, as well as by words written or spoken; by the expected, as well as by the executory agreement. And in the case of a single defendant, his intent may be shown by the same kind of evidence that would be admissible against several joint defendants, as in the case of the dealer in counterfeit money. Evidence that a man has often passed counterfeit money has a legal tendency to show that he intends to pass more of the same kind of money found in his possession. The number of his previous attempts to pass such money affects the weight, not the competency, of this kind of evidence. So, when A has broken and entered B's house, and the question is whether he broke and entered it with a burglarious intent, evidence of his having repeatedly broken and entered other houses for the purpose of stealing tends to show the intent with which he broke and entered B's house.\n\nIn Com. v. Turner  Shearer, 3 Met. 19, 24, 25, this general rule of evidence was applied to a case of kidnapping. The indictment was for kidnapping a negro boy, Sidney, with intent to send him out of the state. There was evidence tending to prove that the defendants got\nSidney into their possession in Worcester, by the false representations of both the defendants to his father that Shearer resided in Palmer and kept a store there, and that Sidney was wanted by Shearer to assist him in that store. Sidney was sent to Virginia. Evidence was received to show that the day before they got Sidney, Turner endeavored to get another negro boy from the almshouse in Shirley, upon a representation that the boy was wanted by Turner's father to live with him in Palmer. This evidence was held competent. The court say, -\"Evidence of other facts than those connected immediately with the act are always admissible, when the intent of the defendant forms a material part of the issue, and when those facts can be supposed to have any proper tendency to establish that intent. Upon recurring to the indictment and the proceedings had thereon upon the trial it will be seen that the intent with which the defendant did the act complained of became material, and was, in fact, a question directly submitted to the jury to pass upon. The intent and purpose of the defendant in obtaining the possession and custody of the individual alleged to be unlawfully taken, were to be inferred from a great variety of circumstances, and necessarily opened a wide door for the introduction of evidence of the acts of the party accused, having any reasonable degree of connection with the particular act complained of. It was with the view of fixing the character of this last act that evidence was received of the conduct and declarations of the defendant on the day previous and at another place, and in reference to another individual about whom overtures were made with a view of obtaining possession of his person. With reference to such a purpose, and thus limited, it seems to us to have been properly admitted.\" On a charge of keeping liquor for sale, evidence that the defendant had previously sold other liquor, or kept other liquor for sale, or was a liquor dealer, is admissible on the question of intent. State v. Plunkett,  64 Me. 534 ; Com. v. Stoehr,  109 Mass. 365 ; Com. v. Dearborn 109 Mass. 368 .\n\nA person's character for chastity, when it is relevant, is not shielded from inquiry. It is a disagreeable subject of investigation; but the law makes no discrimination between subjects that are agreeable and those that are disagreeable. Wood v. Gale,  10 N.H. 247 . Sexual crimes are not excepted as a peculiar class from the operation of the general rule that admits relevant evidence. On an indictment for adultery, evidence of previous improper familiarities is competent. State v. Wallace,  9 N.H. 515 ; State v. Marvin,  35 N.H. 22 ; Com. v. Merriam, 14 Pick. 518; Com. v. Lahey, 14 Gray 91. In Com. v. Horton, 2 Gray 354, and Com. v. Thrasher, 11 Gray 450 it was held that although improper familiarities were competent proof of actual adultery (other than that charged) committed by the same parties with each other was incompetent; but in Thayer v. Thayer,  101 Mass. 111 ,  113 ,  114 , the absurdity of that distinction was acknowledged, and the two cases which established it were overruled. The court say, &#8212; \"When adulterous disposition is shown to exist between the parties at the time of the alleged act, then mere opportunity, with comparatively slight\ncircumstances showing guilt, Will be sufficient to justify the inference that criminal intercourse has actually taken place. The intent and disposition of the parties towards each other must give character to their relations, and can only be ascertained, as all moral qualities are, from the acts and declarations of the parties. It is true that the fact to be proved is the existence of a criminal disposition at the time of the act charged; but the indications by which it is proved may extend and ordinarily do extend over a period of time both anterior and subsequent to it. The rules which govern human conduct and which are known to common observation and experience, are to be applied in these cases as in all other investigations of fact. * * * * By the application of the rule laid down in these cases (Com. v. Horton and Com. v. Thrasher), evidence tending to establish an independent crime is to be rejected, although all acts which are only acts of improper familiarity are to be admitted in proof. There is no sound distinction to be thus drawn. There is no difference between acts of familiarity and actual adultery committed when offered for the purpose indicated, except in the additional weight and significance of the latter fact. The concurrent adulterous disposition of the defendant and the particeps criminis cannot be shown by stronger evidence than the criminal act itself.\"\n\nA \"concurrent adulterous disposition\" in both parties is not necessary to be proved in a case of rape. Williams v. The State, 8 Humph. 585, was an indictment for an assault with intent to commit a rape upon the defendant's daughter. Evidence was received showing his previous attempts to have sexual intercourse with her. And this was held competent to show the intent with which the assault charged in the indictment was committed. The same doctrine prevails in this state. Even Judge BELLOWS, who is understood to have entertained extreme opinions adverse to collateral issues, was not aware of any reason that would justify the court in departing from the principle of our own decisions. State v. Knapp,  45 N.H. 148 ,  156 ,  157 .\n\nSuppose the defendant were tried for breaking and entering the store at the north end of Elm street in Manchester &#8212; the most northern of all the stores on that street &#8212; with intent to steal: suppose it were proved that he broke and entered that store; that he was arrested as soon as he entered it, and the only question were whether he intended to steal: suppose there were one hundred other stores on that street, and he had broken and entered every one of them, and stolen something in every one of them, beginning at the south end of the street and taking the stores in succession, on his burglarious march from one end of the street to the other: suppose he did all this in one night, and was completing his night's work when arrested: on the question of his intent in entering the one hundred and first store, would anybody think of objecting to evidence of his one hundred larcenies in the other one hundred stores? His robbing one hundred stores would tend to show that he intended to rob the one hundred and first, just as his passing counterfeit money in the one hundred would tend to show\nthat he intended to pass counterfeit money found in his possession in the one hundred and first. There would be no difference between his presence in the one hundred and first store, and his having counterfeit money in his pocket in that store, that would, on the question of intent, affect the admissibility of the evidence of what he had done in the other hundred stores. Suppose, instead of robbing stores, he had robbed persons, going from one end of the street to the other, and knocking down and robbing one hundred men, one after the other, and not touching a single woman: suppose, when he had knocked down the one hundred and first man, and before he had had time to rob him, he had been arrested, and the question were whether he intended to rob him, &#8212; whether his last offence were an attempt to rob, or a mere assault, or all assault with intent to kill: would anybody suppose his robbing the other hundred men, after he knocked them down was no evidence of the intent with which he knocked down No. 101? Suppose the one hundred and one persons who he assaulted were women: suppose he touched no man: suppose he had unsuccessfully attempted to ravish one hundred of them, and were arrested at the instant of his knocking down the one hundred and first, and the question were whether his last assault were a mere assault, or an assault with intent to commit a robbery, or an assault with intent to commit a rape: suppose the last woman assaulted should die of her injuries, and the defendant were indicted for her murder: and suppose it were necessary (as some judges in this state, as well as elsewhere, have thought it to be &#8212; State v. Pike, 49 N.E. 399, 404, 405, 406) to allege in the indictment the offence which the defendant was attempting to commit when he struck the blow that unexpectedly proved to be fatal: would Your Honors, if it were your duty to draw the indictment, think it necessary to allege any other attempt than an attempt to commit a rape? Would you think it necessary to allege an attempt to commit a robbery? And how would you expect, if you were the prosecuting officers, to find any better evidence of the defendant's intent than his attempts upon the other one hundred women? It was as necessary for the state to prove the defendant's intent to commit a rape in this case as if it had been necessary to allege such intent in the indictment.\n\nIf the defendant were indicted for kidnapping or attempting to kidnap a negro boy (before the adoption of the 13th amendment), would anybody think it doubtful whether, on the question of intent, other attempts of the defendant to get other negro boys into his possession for a slaveholding purpose would be competent evidence? And, when the intent is the thing to be proved, what difference is there that affects the admissibility of evidence of other similar acts whether the defendant gets a negro boy into his possession with intent to send him into slavery, or whether he gets a girl into his possession, or makes an assault upon her with intent to commit a rape? The proved intent with which he takes possession of the person of one boy or one girl tends to show the intent with which he takes possession of the person of another boy or another girl. In Com. v. Turner, evidence that the\ndefendant attempted to get possession of a negro boy in Shirley, under false pretences tended to show his intent to send that boy into slavery; and evidence of that intent in that case tended to show a similar intent in the other case in which he was indicted. It was precisely as if he had sent one hundred boys from Massachusetts into slavery. The number of instances would affect the weight of the evidence, but not its admissibility. His sending one or more into slavery from Shirley, or getting possession or attempting to get possession of one or more in Shirley for that purpose, would be evidence of the purpose for which he got possession of Sidney in Worcester, just as his passing counterfeit money on one occasion would be evidence of his intent to pass other counterfeit money found in his possession on another occasion. What legal distinction is there between proof of the intent with which the boy Sidney was captured in Worcester, and proof of the intent with which Josie Langmaid was captured in Pembroke? Why  should sexual crimes, aggravated to the pitch of butchery, be so highly favored by the law as to be licensed and exempted from punishment by a special and peculiar dispensation suspending a general rule of evidence?\n\nThe exclusion of evidence on account of its remoteness in point of time or place is the exercise of the discretionary power of the court, passing upon the question as one of fact and not of law. Palmer v. Concord, 48 N.H. 211 ,  219 ; Darling v. Westmoreland,  52 N.H. 401 ,  408  410, 411, and authorities there cited; Haines v. R. T. I. Co.,  52 N.H. 467 ; Hovey v. Grant,  52 N.H. 569 . If too remote in point of time, evidence of other adulteries will be rejected, in the discretion of the judge who tries the case. Thayer v. Thayer,  101 Mass. 111 ,  114 . \"The more detached, in point of time, the previous utterings [of forged bank notes] are the less relation they will bear to that stated in the indictment. * * * It would not make the evidence inadmissible.\" Rex v. Wylie, 1 New Rep. 92, 94 &#8212; S.C. 2 Leach C. C. 973, 985. \"In the trial of that case [State v. Knapp], the judge, in the exercise of what is called judicial discretion, allowed the parties to go back fifteen years; and if he had allowed them to go back sixteen years, or only fourteen, no question of law would have arisen as to the proper length of time.\" Darling v. Westmoreland,  52 N.H. 410 .\n\nOn page 412 of that case, the court refer to State v. Wentworth, 37 N.H. 196 ,  211 , where it is held that the commission by the defendant of other crimes like the one charged is admissible to show that he had the strength and ability to commit the crime alleged in the indictment; and the whole drift of every page of the opinion in Darling v. Westmoreland is distinctly in favor of that principle. But, in the course of a lengthy discussion of the distinction between relevancy as a question of law, and temporal or local remoteness as a question of fact, it is said that in State v. Knapp, on the question of the defendant's strength, evidence of his having committed upon various persons the crime of which he was accused would not be offered, because it is understood to be incompetent. This remark, made in connection with a hearty approval\nof the doctrine of State v. Knapp and State v. Wentworth, seems either to give the erroneous impression that sexual crimes may not be subject to the general rules of evidence, or to suggest that the court, in its discretion, can exclude evidence of other rapes tending to show strength, on the ground that other evidence of strength must be available, and that proof of other rapes would not ordinarily be offered in good faith on the mere question of strength.\n\nAll the evidence objected to in this case, except that of Julienne Rousse, was competent, not only on the question of intent, but also upon the question whether the defendant killed the deceased.\n\nJosie Langmaid was killed October 4, 1875 about nine o'clock in the morning, on the Academy road, on her way to school. On the first day of October, about half past eight o'clock in the morning, about the time the girls would be on their way to the academy, the Cochran boy saw a man jump into the bushes, on the side of the Academy road, springing as if in haste, within a short distance of the place of death. On the twenty-fourth of September, at Fowler's house, the defendant, seeing Fowler's sister come home and go into the house, asked Fowler who she was. Fowler told him. The defendant then wanted to know if she had been to Suncook. Fowler told him no; she had been to school. The defendant then wanted to know which way she went to get there. Fowler told him, and pointed out toward the academy to show the direction; and the defendant said that that must be the way he came when he came out to Kimball's. On September twenty-fifth Fowler carried the defendant home, down Buck street, as far as Locke's; and at Russ's corner the defendant wanted to know if there was where his (Fowler's) sister went to school. Fowler told him no, and pointed out toward the academy again, and told him two miles, or a mile and a half, or a mile, \"and then turn to your right and go up.\" Sunday, September twenty-sixth, Fowler carried his sister back, went to Suncook, and brought the defendant out. As they went past the Academy road, Fowler told the defendant that that was the road on which his sister went to school. About a week before the fourth of October, when the defendant was threshing grain in Fowler's barn, a young lady passed by. The defendant asked Mahair where that gal was going. Mahair said he didn't know. The defendant asked what her name was. Mahair told him her name was Sarah Prentice. The defendant wanted to know where she lived. Mahair told him, going to the door and showing him as near as he could. The defendant wanted to know who was going with her. Mahair said he didn't know. The next day, as Mahair was going through the barn, the defendant stopped him, and asked where that gal went that went down by. Mahair said he didn't know. The defendant wanted to know who went with her. Mahair said he didn't know. The defendant again asked who she was and where she lived; and Mahair showed him where she lived. Again the defendant asked who went with her, and said he wondered which road she went on the most, and made an obscene and vulgar remark and inquiry concerning\nher. On the second of October, about nine o'clock in the morning, about the time the girls would be on their way to the academy, Towle and his wife met the defendant on the Academy road, about fifty or sixty rods from the place of death. The defendant was carrying a stick behind him, similar in all respects to a stick afterwards found, broken and stained with blood, near the place of death. On the last Sunday of September, Anna Watson, on her weekly return from her home in Allenstown to her school in Hooksett, was pursued by the defendant a considerable distance, and until he came in sight of Mack or Mercy, when he suddenly disappeared in the woods. He carried a club, and his face was red and excited. He ran after her more than half a mile.\n\nAll this evidence tends to show that the defendant killed Josie Langmaid. It shows that the neighborhood of the place of death was his hunting-ground, and it shows the object and intent of his habitual hunt. Change all this evidence only so far as to substitute partridges for women, &#8212; and suppose the question were, whether this defendant killed a partridge, found cut in pieces where the remains of Josie Langmaid were scattered: if his talk with Fowler, relating to Fowler's sister, had related to partridges; if he had inquired, not which way she was accustomed to go to school, but where partridges were plenty; if Fowler had twice told him they abounded on the Academy road, and pointed out the place; if his remarks and inquiries addressed to Mahair had not related to Sarah Prentice and the road she went on the most, and had not been obscene and vulgar, but had been such as to show he was meditating a partridge-hunt; if his interrupted chase of Anna Watson had been an interrupted attempt to kill partridges, &#8212; would any one object to all this evidence on the ground that it did not show a special intent to kill the particular partridge that was found dead? If a man had been robbed at the place of death, would all this evidence, so far altered as to relate to men accustomed to carry large amounts of money, be excluded, because the man who was robbed was not one of those concerning whose route the defendant had previously inquired, or whom he had previously pursued? How would the competency of such evidence be affected by the circumstance that, by some accident, the travellers concerning whom the defendant inquired happened to escape, and that another happened to be the victim? &#8212; or by the circumstance that in one instance the robbing intent was exhibited by a pursuit more significant than such an inquiry about a person's route as tends to show a design to waylay or pursue him? The gist of such evidence is not merely in showing an intent to rob the particular travellers, who providentially escaped, but in showing an intent to rob any one who would be likely to have what the defendant wanted. Are professional highwaymen to be acquitted by the exclusion of previous intentions, preparations, and attempts, because such evidence relates to anybody they may meet, and not to the particular victim named in the indictment? Is the region round about every girls' school in the land to be infested, as the neighborhood of this academy was, by a professional\nhunter of women, a fugitive from justice, flying from a foreign country to this for the safe continuance of his business? And are such men to be encouraged by being excepted from the rules of evidence that apply to forgers and counterfeiters? Are our daughters to be exposed to human beasts of prey, incited to their diabolical work by an exemption from the operation of those general principles by which even our miserable currency is protected?\n\nThe testimony of the Cochran boy tends to show that about school-time some man was prowling about the Academy road, who was unwilling to be seen and recognized by that boy. It tends to show that Josie Langmaid's death was not accidental. Why was that boy allowed to pass unharmed? His sex saved him. Is not that fair matter of inference and argument? The defendant hunted neither men, nor boys, nor old women. The fact that Fowler's sister was accustomed to go to the academy, over the Academy road, was a subject that interested him on September 24, 25 and 26. On October 2, about the time the girls would be going to school, he walked on that road carrying a stick, similar in all respects to the one found two days afterwards, broken and stained with blood, near the place of death. His talk with Fowler about Fowler's sister, his talk with Mahair about Sarah Prentice, and his pursuit of Anna Watson, tend to show that Josie Langmaid's death was not accidental; that she fell a victim to the purpose for which the defendant hunted in that region, &#8212; the purpose for which he so eagerly and repeatedly inquired about the usual routes of Fowler's sister and Sarah Prentice, &#8212; the purpose for which he so hotly pursued Anna Watson. If he hunted beasts of the field or fowls of the air in that neighborhood, that fact would be evidence on the question whether a beast or bird (of the class which he hunted), found killed in that neighborhood, was killed by him. If he went forth to rob any one he might meet, that fact would be evidence on a question of robbery.\n\nThe testimony of Cochran, Fowler, Mahair, Towle and wife, Mrs. Watson and daughter, and Mercy, tends to show that the defendant roamed about that district for some purpose; that his purpose was not to pick berries, as Mack did, not to rob any one of money, not to escort the feebler sex through woods and bushes, and protect them against the peculiar insults and outrages to which that sex is exposed in solitary places, not to revive the spirit and practice of chivalry for the defence of women, but to practice upon them the reviving ferocity of a barbaric age. And Josie Langmaid was found killed and mutilated in a manner corresponding to the purpose for which he ranged that part of the country.\n\nAll the evidence which I have thus far considered tends to show that the defendant killed the deceased, and also the intent with which he killed her.\n\nII. The jury having found, on other evidence than that of Julienne Rousse, that the defendant committed the homicide, her testimony was competent to show the intent with which he committed it. Her testimony\nwas, that he committed a rape upon her, at St. Beatrice in Canada, four years and four months before the homicide. It was necessary for the state to prove the defendant's intent to commit a rape on the deceased. If he killed her without premeditation, in a struggle consequent upon his insulting her, or committing an indecent assault upon her, without any raping intent, there was no ground on which he could be found guilty of the first degree of murder. And all the other evidence might be explained on a hypothesis of that kind, consistent with his innocence of that degree of murder. Whether such an explanation would raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of any juror, who can tell? It was the duty of the state to leave no room for doubt. And on the question whether his intent was to commit an indecent assault, or to commit a rape, what better evidence could be had than his intent on other similar occasions when he was not interrupted and defeated, as he was in his pursuit of Anna Watson? If a man's intent to pass counterfeit money at one time is evidence of his intent to pass other counterfeit money found in his possession at another time; if his intent to sell liquor at one time is evidence of his intent to sell other liquor at another time; if his intent to send one negro boy into slavery is evidence of his intent to make the same disposition of another found in his possession, &#8212; why is not his intent to commit a rape upon Julienne Rousse, when he took possession of her, evidence of his intent to make the same disposition of Josie Langmaid, when he took possession of her? Manifestly the only objection to this evidence is the remoteness of the rape in point of time and place. It is settled by the authorities which I have cited, that that objection raises a question of fact within the discretion of the court, and not a question of law. The question of discretion is reserved. Should the judgment be reversed, and a new trial granted, on the ground that, as a matter of fact, the rape to which Julienne Rousse testified was temporally or locally too remote to be entitled to any weight on the question whether the intent with which the defendant assaulted the deceased was the same as that with which he assaulted Julienne Rousse?\n\nIf he had passed counterfeit money at the time and place when and where he raped Julienne Rousse, and other counterfeit money had been found in his possession at the time and place when and where he killed Josie Langmaid; if he had sold liquor at the former time and place, and other liquor had been found in his possession at the latter time and place; if he had got a negro boy into his possession at the former time and place with intent to send him into slavery, and had got another negro boy into his possession at the latter time and place, &#8212; would there be any doubt that his intent on the former occasion would in fact be considered, by every intelligent member of the human family as entitled to some weight on the question of his intent on the latter occasion? If a ship-master lands in Congo obtains a cargo of blacks, and carries them to Cuba, and four years and four months afterwards he is found at another place on the African coast, as far from Congo as Pembroke academy is from St. Beatrice, with a hundred blacks in his possession, &#8212;\nwould anybody think that his proved intent on the former occasion had, as a matter of fact, no tendency to show what he intended to do on the latter occasion? What want of analogy is there between making prisoners of blacks at such different times and places, and making prisoners of these two young women? What is there in the color of the captives in the former case that can carry more significance, from the proved intent of their captor in one abduction to the question of his intent in another, than is carried in this case by their age and sex? or carry the significance across a greater interval of time or place? What is there in the act, the circumstances, or the intent of kidnapping, or passing counterfeit money, or selling liquor, that makes us feel the probative force of the proved intent of one occasion upon the question of intent four years and four months afterward, and prevents our feeling any probative force of such evidence in the present case? There is no distinction that can exempt sexual cases from the effect of the operation of such evidence upon the human mind, or shorten in those cases the temporal or local distance reached by such evidence in other cases. That is plainly true, as a matter of fact; and it is a mere matter of fact that we are considering.\n\nThe distance of place is immaterial. The defendant could have gone in a few hours from the place where he clutched Julienne Rousse, to the place where he pounced upon Josie Langmaid. There was nothing in either of the places peculiarly calculated to create or destroy an intent to pass counterfeit money or to commit a sexual crime. The distance of time is the only possible ground of objection.\n\nOn this point I must appeal to the court as I would appeal to a jury, because the question is one not of law, but of fact. If your honors were the sole tribunal, trying the defendant upon this indictment, and sworn to decide upon grounds of natural law, natural reason, and human experience, upon such evidence as on those grounds seemed capable of affording any light, would you receive the testimony of Julienne Rousse? I do not hesitate to assert that you would receive it, and weigh it. No man on earth would refuse to hear it, or to consider it, unless he were bound by some arbitrary and irrational rule overriding his understanding, and dictating a course at war with his commonsense. Your honors would give it some weight, because you would infallibly know, from the teaching of history and universal experience, your knowledge of human nature, and the authority of an intuition superior to all artificial reasoning, that the evidence of the intent with which the defendant seized Julienne Rousse has some tendency to show the intent with which he seized Josie Langmaid, notwithstanding the two seizures were separated by the distance of four years and four months. Whether the weight of the evidence is diminished by that lapse of time, and if so how much, are questions that do not arise here. But the question whether your honors, in the supposed trial, would receive the evidence and give it some weight, is the very question to be decided in this case, &#8212; for it is settled that whether evidence should be excluded for temporal or local remoteness is a question of fact, and\nnot a question of law; and the question of fact here is, whether, on those grounds of natural law, natural reason, and human experience, upon which such a question of fact must be decided, the intent with which the defendant assaulted Julienne Rousse is capable of affording any light on the intent with which he assaulted the deceased.\n\nFor error in a ruling on a question of law, the court might feel bound by precedent to grant a new trial although satisfied that no injustice had been done. But on this question of discretion, in which not law, but justice alone is concerned, will the court reverse the judgment of the circuit court, without any cause to believe that the defendant has suffered actual wrong?\n\nIt will be admitted, I suppose, that every intelligent person, untrammelled by technical rules, will concur in the opinion of the circuit court. And the question being one of pure fact unmixed with law, and therefore not subject to technical rules, on what ground will any one dissent from the unanimous judgment of the rest of mankind? If that unanimous judgment were a conclusion of metaphysical subtlety, or scholastic sophistry or a blind faith based on an evident obliquity of mental or moral vision, a misunderstanding of natural phenomena, ignorance of the laws of the material or spiritual universe, or a tradition or superstition that had survived the low civilization of its origin, it might be a feeble authority. But it is the spontaneous and irreversible judgment of every grade of intellect that has appeared, or is likely to appear, in this state of existence. It is an involuntary and unavoidable perception of the inherent and self-evident relations of conduct and intention; a mental revelation as natural as memory, and as trustworthy and unanswerable as consciousness. Why should any one be particularly anxious in this case, to introduce not a legal principle, but a dogma of fact, refuted by the instinctive knowledge of the whole human race? If, in the administration of justice, the experiment is to be tried of deciding such questions of fact as this in defiance of the innate and universal logic of rational creatures, it certainly is not necessary that this class of cases should be selected for the attempt. In asking that the experiment may not be first tried in a case of this kind, I utter the fervent remonstrance and prayer of every father and mother who has a daughter at school or at home, exposed to the fate of Georgie Lovering and Josie Langmaid. [fn*] \n\nW. T. Norris (with whom were S. B. Page and E. W. Greene), for the respondent.\n\nIn urging our bill of exceptions, what of it relates to the testimony of Julienne Rousse will first be considered.\n\nCommenting on the use the jury might make of it, the court gave them this instruction: \"It is a fundamental principle of law, that evidence that the defendant committed one offence cannot be received to prove that he committed another and distinct offence.\" Here is a familiar principle well enough stated. It is indeed fundamental &#8212; old as the common law, and wise as common-sense.\n\nNo claim is made by us to exclude her testimony from use, under the direction of the court, because it proves another offence, but because it proves a distinct offence. Put the word transaction in the place of the word offence, and we encounter the same objection. It all rests on the ground of distinction. Want of connection &#8212; the crime disclosed with the crime charged &#8212; is the reason of the exclusion. It has no other foundation.\n\nCrime is made up of act and intent combined. Without the evil intent, or what amounts to it in law, there is no guilt. Without the overt act there is no sin, in the eye of human tribunals. And it seems to be agreed on all hands that such evidence as hers is not competent in proof of the act of murder. Up to this point there is no controversy. \"Only upon the question of intention, and thus upon the degree of guilt,\" does the court below attempt to make it competent.\n\nNo exception was taken to the charge, because the use the jury was instructed to put the evidence to, after it was in, was perhaps as well for our client as any charge could have directed. Our objection went to its admission. It went in subject to our objection. As it went in, the jury were free to use it on any question before them. If only two questions were in issue, they could use it on either. But the court tells them they must use it on but one of the two. How could we object to that? What is the exception to that charge? After deferring unduly, as we believe the court did, and against our exception, to what the external exigencies of the cause were clamorously demanding, what right had we then to object to a partial correction of the error and prevention of the injury? Why talk about \"an unexceptionable charge\"? We could not object to what was charged in our favor. Our wish was, that nothing be charged as to how this evidence might be used. Our objection to its admission would then have its full force. If the charge had been that it be not used at all, we had to that charge no valid objection. But the jury would have had the evidence, and we might have lost our objection to its admission. What the court did say in the charge we could not object to, and still, the more it did not say, the better for the objection already taken. We were in a strait, with the less said the better. But do not call it \"unexceptionable.\" \"Take any shape but that,\" my adroit friend. Our firm nerves tremble, and our cheeks blanch, before even a shade of a ghost of a right slaughtered or lost by our negligence. Do not try to save your verdict by making a \"corner\" on us for not excepting to the charge. What then is \"the only question of law raised by the bill of exceptions\"? Not, we submit, \"whether the evidence objected\nto is admissible for any purpose. No claim is made that the evidence we are now considering has any legal tendency to show that the defendant killed the deceased.\" Has it any legal tendency to  show \"that he intended to commit a rape upon her\"? Is the intent to commit a rape upon her in question? It is the act, either of attempt or perpetration of that crime, resulting in murder, that must be shown. No matter about any express intention. One may be implied if the act be proved. Our objection to the evidence raised the question whether it was inadmissible for any reason. It may be competent on one ground, but incompetent on another ground. Under our general exception, we take it we have the benefit of this distinction. How much of it is taken away from us by the special charging of the court? Pray, give us all there is left. And, even then, do not hang our client because the court below erred in not assigning him counsel a match for all the regular and special counsel for the state, aided by a whole train of them from over the border.\n\nActual proof of intention is not always needed. Malice, the essence of all crime, may be express or implied. Brown v. Commonwealth, 76 Penn. 319.\n\nIt is not indispensable to a conviction that a motive be proved. People v. Robinson, 1 Parker C. R. 644.\n\nMurder by a free moral agent, when no motive or provocation is shown, we take it, must be of the first degree. Under the laws of causation, claimed to be universal, sane men act from motives. Madness may have method in it; but with a sound mind and well proved act as given data, all needed motive is presumed. And in the case at bar, no real intention to murder need be either proved or implied. It is enough if a rape was attempted or perpetrated, and the murder followed. Take away the rape and the attempt of it, and fix the act of killing upon the respondent, and then his crime, without other proof of intent, takes the utmost degree of enormity. \"Sex, age, and mutilation\" may not alone bridge over \"the wide gulf between\" murder and death from accident, disease, or suicide, or the thousand and one mere figments of the brain that may be conjured up to hold open the door the circuit court ought to have kept shut and securely barred. But the point we make here is, that no actual proof of express malice of any kind was made essential, by any phase of allegation or answer either in pleadings or proofs the case presented.\n\nUnder our statute defining the degrees of murder, arson, rape, robbery, and burglary, in conditions there given, are merged in the greater crime, as much as poisoning, starving, or torturing. Hence, none of these acts thus ending in murder can be the motive of the murder. No act or thing, nor any part of it, can be the cause of its own being. Instead of motives, then, these acts or attempts are mere methods or occasions of the murder. Hence, evidence tending to prove the act of rape tends by the same token to prove the act of murder; and if it is to be excluded because it tends to prove the act of murder, by the same rule it must be excluded from proving the act of rape.\n\nPremeditation of crime, or the means to do it with, may precede the bare act of it a long time. Hence, evidence of them may seem to take a wide range in both time and space. Buying poison may be shown, or stealing it, no doubt, with burglary and arson, perhaps; it may be a witness of a former crime, or a particeps criminis liable to turn state's evidence, who is put out of the way; prior like attempts on the same person or thing, or like crimes on other persons, but standing in similar relations and giving rise to the same motives; sexual crimes, or acts indicating a desire of change in marriage relations: &#8212; in all these cases, and many more found in the books, a prior crime may be disclosed; but in all of them this disclosure is a mere incident, not, as in the case at bar, an element, or the burden of the evidence. And this we understand to be the true rule and spirit of all the authorities. It completely covers and disposes of all the murder cases cited on the other side: on a charge of shooting with intent to kill &#8212; proof, shooting at the same person at another time; charge, murder of her husband by poison &#8212; proof, three of her sons being subsequently poisoned; charge, murdering her children by poison &#8212; proof, two other children of hers, and a lodger in the house, had died of poison; charge, murder of Garner's mother by poison &#8212; proof, the wife, also charged, had lived in his family as a servant when his first wife died, and that she died of poison; charge, murdering her infant by suffocation in bed &#8212; proof, deaths of her other children at early ages; charge, murdering H. &#8212; proof, H. had been employed by the defendant to murder P.; charge, murdering the defendant's wife &#8212; proof, his adulterous intercourse with another woman; charge, murder &#8212; proof, adulterous intercourse between the defendant and the wife of the deceased; &#8212; not a single one of them in violation of the rule laid down in Shaffner v. Commonwealth, 72 Penn. 60. \"To make one criminal act evidence of another, a connection between them must have existed in the mind of the actor, linking them together for some purpose he intended to accomplish.\"\n\nTake the authority quoted in the charge: \"Whenever the evidence which tends to prove the other crime tends also to prove this one, not merely by showing the prisoner to be a bad man, but by showing the particular bad intent to have existed in his mind at the time he did the act complained of, it is admissible;\" &#8212; not merely by showing, as in this case, that the prisoner had a native propensity, by him held in common in kind with all other men, liable, in him and them, to be inordinately inflamed; nor by merely showing him to be a bad man, because in him it had been so inflamed in a single instance by a single person, a member of his family, after years of familiarity and perhaps fascination, but by showing this particular bad intent or inflammation of passion to have actuated him at this time, and on this occasion.\n\nTake our own case &#8212; State v. Knapp &#8212; cited on the other side. On one point we do not believe in its doctrine. It is not well considered. It has some aid from other cases, but it is not sound logic, it is not\ngood law, it is not common-sense, to infer, as it does, an act of such extreme criminality from incipient acts ordinarily having a much less criminal but more natural ending; but on proving strength to commit the crime alleged, it is sound as a rock. Physical strength is a physical fact, to be proved like any other physical fact, when courts and juries are expected to use their own experience and observation of the natural course of things. Suppose, in the case, the ability of the defendant in another direction to commit the rape had been in issue &#8212; that he was a man or his victim a woman: evidence then, if needed, might have gone back to the time of their births without touching any question of discretion. My brother does not venture this case out on the first point, and on the last he entirely mistakes its meaning. Courts have no discretion in admitting or rejecting legal testimony. In middle life a man's strength may be well shown from exertions of it fifteen or twenty years back. It would not do to go so far back on those made by a boy of twenty, or an old man of seventy-five. In either case they would not be evidence. And this is about all there is of discretion on questions of evidence.\n\nWhen the scienter or quo animo becomes an essential factor in the problem of guilt or innocence to be solved; when proof of malice becomes indispensable to a conviction, &#8212; such evidence of other like acts may then be competent. Wharton's Crim. Laws 649. It is so when proof of the motive becomes peculiarly material on account of some peculiarity of the crime, or its dependence on some peculiar motive, &#8212; when the act is innocent, as a rule, and its criminality the exception. Under this head we can dispose of all the cases cited on the other side, or found in the books, of forgery, counterfeiting, uttering base paper or coin, embezzling, obtaining money and goods under false pretences, fraudulently conveying or pledging property, kidnapping boys, and other fraudulent transactions. In such cases the intent is always material to be proven. It can rarely, if ever, be inferred, because the act, or what constitutes that part of the crime, is just like what is innocently done by everybody in the every-day business of life. Notes and obligations are signed and negotiated, clerks and agents are trusted and entrusted, boys hired, with traffic in all its endless ramifications, running in debt, failing and running away, tight places, temptations, pride, pinching poverty, with money in all hands, hard and soft, going the rounds of circulation, begetting a love of it, the root of all evil, and giving occasion or motive for a great number of offences, both malum in se et malum prohibitum, known to modern civilization and law, where intention of wrong-doing is often almost the only index and exponent of the criminality. In these cases, the mind the thing is done with is the question of questions; and, mind you, the act is proved, or not questioned. Hence, it stands to reason that the intent or knowledge this act &#8212; innocent or indifferent in itself, it may be &#8212; is done with may well be learned from other acts of the same kind, done under the direction of the same mind. Perhaps the rule is best put in the words of Lord MANSFIELD: \"When all act, in itself indifferent, becomes criminal if done with\na particular intent, then the intent must be proved and found; but when the act is in itself unlawful, the proof of justification or excuse lies on the defendant, &#8212; and in case of failure thereof the law implies a criminal intent.\"\n\nIn a murder case, cited in a note in Roscoe's Crim. Ev., page 92, as Heath's case, 1 Harnson 507, evidence was held competent to prove that the accused, on the same day the deceased was killed, and shortly before the killing, shot a third person, &#8212; though it proved a distinct felony, as it appeared to be connected with the crime charged as a part of the same transaction. Not being able to see the full reported case, its doctrine as digested is not verified. Obviously the term \"distinct\" is not used in the sense of disconnected, any further than to mark two distinct felonies. It has no reference to a separation of the acts constituting the crimes; they were connected as parts of one transaction. Hence the case comes within the rule, that to be competent, one crime to prove the other, they must be connected. With a slight expansion, and perhaps without, this case seems well enough to cover the chain of facts so closely connected together in Elm street and in my brother's fertile brain, extending from one end of it to the other &#8212; meaning the street, of course &#8212; taken \"in succession,\" and \"all in one night.\" Regina v. Cobben, 3 F.  F. 833, is exactly in point, where, on a trial for breaking into a booking office of a railway station, evidence was admitted that the prisoner had, on the same night, broken into three other booking offices of other stations, \"on the ground of the four cases being all mixed up together.\"\n\nIt is hardly worth while for me to review any more cases cited by counsel for prosecution. Our case is murder. On trial, it is proposed to show a murder committed in perpetrating or attempting to perpetrate rape. Evidence in proof of that charge was offered, tending to show that four years and more before, the defendant committed rape without murder on another person in a distant country. We objected. Objection overruled. Evidence admitted. Jury instructed to use it in finding intention only, and thus finding degree of crime. No claim is made that the evidence helps to find intent, only in so far forth as it helps to find a bent of mind or inclination to commit that kind of crimes. We say no such help is legal, whether claimed as a question of logic, law, or discretion. No case has been cited looking our objections squarely in the face. And if the rule of evidence, sought for by the prosecution, cannot be found in capital cases, this court will not seek far for guides in this case in paths taken in tracing out men's ways that are dark, in killing horses, hunting partridges, or putting money in the purse.\n\nIt is not competent to show that one has a tendency to commit crimes like the one he is charged with. State v. Renton,  15 N.H. 169 . It is not proper to raise a presumption of guilt on the ground that, having committed one crime, the depravity it exhibits makes it likely he would commit another.\n\nShaffner v. Commonwealth, 72 Penn. 60, is a modern case, in a strong\ncourt, well considered, and almost exactly in point. Case: &#8212; Shaffner indicted for murder of wife by poison; wife died June, 1871; evidence to show death from poison; main question, was it administered by husband; evidence of improper intimacy with one Susan Sharlock; evidence of symptoms of wife's death; evidence offered that a first wife, who died in September, 1869, and John Sharlock, Susan's husband, who died in February, 1871, both died at the defendant's house, with similar symptoms as last wife, and that all of them were under his care at the time they died. Evidence as to first wife, rejected; as to John Sharlock, admitted; &#8212; verdict, guilty; motion for new trial overruled; sentenced to be hung; writ of error to supreme court; new trial ordered, because of admission of this evidence. Here we have two cases, and others might be cited, &#8212; one, our own, and some time back, by as able a court as we ever had; the other, of very recent date. by an able court, fully sustaining the whole ground of our exceptions now under consideration.\n\nNo well read lawyer need be told that the doctrine of these cases is the doctrine of all the best earlier authorities. Indeed, until quite recent times, it was so far removed from debatable ground as not to be questioned. We may differ about the reason of its existence. It may have owed its birth to a sacred care for human life, to a judicial protest against sanguinary legislation, or to a conviction that disposition of mind, even when use has bred a habit, is too frail a premise to draw inferences from, bearing on issues of life or death. Whatever its reason, nobody doubts it existed. And we ask the court to consider whether or not it may come under the provision of the constitution, that \"all the laws which have usually been practised on in the courts of laws, shall remain and be in full force until altered and repealed by the legislature.\" How much rules of evidence may come within the scope of this provision, perhaps, has never been determined. We are not sure, but think the point worth considering. Interest in the result of a cause, as a bar to the person testifying, had to be or was let down by act of legislation.\n\nNo rule of law is bettor settled than that the \"evidence shall be confined to the point in issue.\" My brother insists on it, but likes the terms \"pertinent\" and \"relevant\" better. We insist on it, and do not care about the terms. It makes no odds that we know of how many circumstantial facts are put in evidence. What the rule demands is, that they be each one circumstantial &#8212; circum stans &#8212; standing around, each one to be proved as a primary premise, not as an inference from which the conclusion or verdict is to be drawn. \"Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind\" may be sensible enough, but throwing up straws to tell which way it will blow four years hence, lacks wit as well as poetry. It is of the nature of water to run down hill &#8212; it has a strong tendency that way; but who would think of inferring hence alone that a given water had run down a given hill? Making no point of remoteness in time or space, let us see how well this evidence will bear analyzing. Premise to be proved: he committed a rape, in no\nway, except in kind, connected with this crime. Inference: a general disposition to commit this kind of offence. Next premise: this general disposition in him. Inference: he committed this particular offence. \"Presumptions of fact are in truth but mere arguments.\" Hence, as all the evidentiary aid one of these acts gets from the other is through this presumption of general disposition, it is but mere argument. No mark, except the class mark of kind, have they in common. And why such proof has not been used is because the argument is too far-fetched &#8212; \"too thin\" &#8212; an inference from a presumption; a chain of reasoning of two or three links, with ample hiding-places for abundant fallacies. It maybe tried \"by the common test of the validity of arguments.\" Some men who commit a single crime have, or thereby acquire, a tendency to commit the same kind of crimes; &#8212; if this man committed the rape, he might therefore have or thereby acquire a tendency to commit other rapes; if he had or so acquired such a tendency, and if another rape was committed within his reach, he might therefore be more likely to be guilty; if so more likely to be guilty of rape, and if there was a murder committed in perpetrating or attempting to perpetrate rape, he might therefore be more likely to be guilty of this rape, and hence of this murder; &#8212; a sort of an ex-parte conviction of a single rape, from which the jury are to find a general disposition to that kind of crimes, in order to help them out in presuming the commission of another rape as a motive or occasion of the murder. We can find nothing like it in the books: and much of the best ability in the profession is all up in arms against this innovation.\n\nAs a question of logic, then, there is no evidentiary power in this testimony, entitling it to use in a trial of this kind. As a question of law, we have already attempted to show that, if it has any such power, it cannot be used here. And now we say, if there be any question of discretion about it, it ought not to be used. On this point, the reasoning of the court in Shaffner v. Commonwealth, already cited, suggests all that need be said. But we take no time on this point. If the point of law does not save us, we cannot, in the nature of the case, hope much from that of discretion. In fact, we do not believe much in questions of discretion when a man's life is at stake. Hanging ought not to go by discretion. It is our client's last chance for his life. He is entitled to a fair trial by \"due process of law,\" even if \"his complexion be perfect gallows.\" And due process of law does not go much on discretion. All the light the jury sees his case in ought to be pure legal testimony. It should all emanate from the elements and incidents of the tragedy. It may get toned or shaded in transmission, not unlike the rays of sunlight by refraction, but, when it passes the bench to the panel, it must be free from court coloring or discretion.\n\nMurder will out. Its witnesses, though dumb, will speak. If need be, the voice of murdered blood will cry out from the ground. Each new case has its peculiar horror. Now and then \"a devil, a born devil,\" who \"like the shark and tiger must have prey,\" will run a terrible race in crime before detection. But be sure his crimes will find him\nout. Innocent men will sometimes be accused. Even \"the most guilty criminal may be innocent of other offences charged against him, of which he might acquit himself if fairly tried.\" \"He may be guilty of them, and still innocent of the one with which he stands charged.\" No one can tell how soon he may be the victim of seeming adverse circumstances. Such things have been, and may be again. And when they do come, a wise and firm administration of the law, in the face and eyes of popular indignation, is our only city of refuge.\n\nWho knows the jury \"found the homicide committed by the defendant, on other evidence than that\" we have been considering? Is it so said by a general verdict of guilty? It is not so said by the case made by the court allowing the exceptions. My brother says it in his argument. And it is just here that our exceptions, as it seems to me, take on their most formidable proportions. Even my learned brother, after years of experience in the trial of criminal cases, gets confused and misled, or means to mislead, as to the use made of this testimony. It is said by the court, in Shaffner v. Commonwealth,  &#8212; \"Logically, the commission of an independent offence is not proof of itself of the commission of another crime. Yet it cannot be said to be without influence on the mind, for, certainly, if one be shown to be guilty of another crime equally henious [heinous], it will prompt a more ready belief that he might have committed the one with which he is charged; it therefore predisposes the mind of the juror to believe the prisoner guilty.\" It tends to give undue prominence and force and weight to all the other evidence in the case for the prosecution. It detracts, in like manner, but in double portion, from all the evidence in his defence. It prejudices the jury against him, and inclines them to look with suspicion on all who come forward to testify in his favor. Hence, it is \"not only unjust to the prisoner to compel him to acquit himself of two offences instead of one, but it is detrimental to justice to burden a trial with multiplied issues, that tend to confuse and mislead the jury.\" And the problem for \"human reason and human experience\" to solve, in view of this \"natural law,\" is, not what rule is desirable to be applied in a given case, but what one, on the whole, is wisest and best to be applied in all cases.\n\nWho can say that \"no injustice has been done\"? We have found that neither tendency to crime, evil disposition, nor bad character can enter the lists as circumstantial evidence. 1 Phillips Ev. (7th ed.) 181. Even admissions made of a similar crime, and of a tendency of mind that way, cannot be competent. 1 Chitty Crim. Law 504. Proof that the accused was influenced by a strong motive of interest to commit the offence charged, ought never to operate in proof of the corpus delicti. 1 Starkie Ev. 490. When tendency of mind is excluded, what vestige of the first crime is left, by which the defendant is to be traced to the last one? Neither mental nor moral science has as yet been able to mark out a path by metes and bounds, nor even to blaze a trail, by which this border land of probabilities may safely be entered in legal criminal investigations.\n\nIn questions of character, it is held that mere proof of isolated facts can afford no presumption &#8212; 1 Taylor's Ev., sec. 326; and if not of character, who of tendency of mind or disposition &#8212; a mere element of character? Crime is possible of everybody; it is probable of nobody. We might cite any amount of authority against inviting juries, much more sending them, out on voyages of conjecture and speculation. Investigating possibilities of crime is not their province; and this testimony touches on possibilities. \"Seven hundred pounds, with possibilities, is good gifts.\" But proof of a single crime, years agone, with possibilities after, is had evidence.\n\nMy brother says \"this evidence was cumulative.\" What evidence he means we are not quite certain. If he means what we have been talking about as no evidence, then his notion of cumulating with it, or on it, is, in our estimation, like what somebody &#8212; Tom Hood, is it? &#8212; says about increasing, cumulating, a wife's salary: it was nothing before, and so it was doubled. If it has no legal status in court, it can neither cumulate nor be cumulated. Here there can be no distinction between its relevancy as a question of law, and its temporal or local connection as a question of discretion.\n\nNor is the question of good faith in putting it in in question. We say it was put in by the counsel for the prosecution without any indication to the court, the jury, the respondent, or his counsel, as to how it might be used. No such indication came from the court till all the evidence in the case was closed, and this evidence had done its work. We make no point of good or bad faith; we merely state a fact. If the jury found the defendant on other evidence guilty of this homicide, then there was no need of any more evidence. Commonwealth v. Webster, 5 Cush. 305; Commonwealth v. York, 9 Met. 93, and cases there cited from other state and foreign courts.\n\nWe are not driven to charge bad faith, or even that injustice was done. It is enough that it may have been done.\n\nIn Regina v. Oddy, 4 Cox C. C., Lord CAMPBELL, after saying \"The law of England does not allow one crime to be proved in order to raise a probability that another crime has been committed by the perpetrator of the first,\" adds this logical and common-sense caution: \"Allowing evidence to be given of the uttering of other forged notes to other persons has gone to great lengths, and I should be unwilling to see that rule applied generally in the administration of the criminal laws.\" Prejudice is a wily fellow in a jury-box. He had full license &#8212; carte blanche &#8212; with this testimony for a long time, before the court called him to any account. Hence the burden is on the other side. Not one of the jurors can tell how much his mind was confused or misled. Law is exceedingly jealous of both these clouds on reason and judgment; but the testimony was in there, liable to do mischief, and that is enough for our purpose.\n\nIn Coleman v. People,  55 N.Y. 90 , a late case, it is said by the court, all the judges concurring on this point, &#8212; \"The general rule is against receiving evidence of another offence,\" \"however persuasive\nthe evidence may be in a moral point of view.\" Same case before the same court in  56 N.Y. 591 , and affirmed. Up again in  58 N.Y. 555 ; general doctrine reaffirmed, where the court said, &#8212; \"The true rule, and the only rule that can be sustained on principle, is, that the intendment of law is that an error in the admission of evidence is prejudicial to the party objecting, and will be ground for reversal of the judgment, unless the intendment is clearly repelled by the record. The error must be shown conclusively to be innoxious.\"\n\nIt is not this defendant alone who is on trial in this court. If he \"has received no actual wrong,\" as we contend he has, and as there is, to say the least, a chance for, in piecing up the detached fragments of evidence in his case, law and the course of justice have a right to complain. We speak now for the integrity of the rules of evidence. We may have monsters of crime in our day. Old-fashioned notions may not be quite up to my brother's anxiety in dealing with cases of modern depravity. He seems still haunted by the ghost of one subject for a mad-house, sent to the halter on his own confession. And has he himself partaken of the insane root, that he would obliterate the line between judges and juries, and let men be tried for their lives on such \"grounds of natural law, natural reason, and human experience,\" as any twelve men, picked by chance from like chance pickings from men selected without reference to special aptness or training, may chance to adopt in a jury-room? Is he prepared to denounce any rule of evidence, deemed wise and salutary hitherto, as arbitrary and irrational, because it happens to stand in the way of a conviction of a man whom, in his zeal, he has come to regard as surely guilty? Your honors might give some weight to the evidence on the question of interest, if certain both crimes were committed, and committed by the same person.\n\nBut just here, the \"teaching of history and universal experience, your own knowledge of human nature, and the authority of an intuition superior to all artificial reasoning,\" all admonish you not to trust to a jury evidence of a fact entirely disconnected from the main fact and not made certain, from which to draw such inferences as their whim or caprice may dictate of a man who has been followed by a hue and cry of the whole community ever since the detectives first thought they scented his track, crossing the trail they were following of the first man by them beat out of cover in hunting for the author of this terrible tragedy. No man on earth would be willing to trust his life to such an ordeal.\n\nIn the next place, we will make short work of the rest of our bill of exceptions.\n\nIt need hardly be said that what has been considered we regard as its head and front. In justice to myself, perhaps, I ought to say that I rely but little on any of the rest.\n\nAll the testimony tending to prove his chasing the Watson girl we regard as clearly irrelevant, on the ground that it comes to nothing,\nand therefore is mischievous. It was two weeks before the murder; it was three or four miles away from the scene of it, and not in the same direction from his residence; it was a day, and the same time of day, when other people were out in the same locality, on what they, no doubt, deemed innocent pastimes. At least two other men are shown to be on or near the same road at the same times and places when and where he was seen. Nothing bad is shown of him but haste and excitement. He was never seen near the girl except when her mother was present.\n\nWe wish to make this general remark as to all this class of testimony. It is all open to two constructions. None of it of necessity points to anything. Taken against a man suspected, it becomes suspicious; without extraneous aid, it is all entirely indifferent. But what was submitted in a former brief is all that need be said on this point.\n\nWe make no appeals: we crave right and justice. Give us a fair trial. We expect to meet all the evidence properly connecting us with this horrid crime. Against that we can take no exception. But if the jury were improperly influenced in their findings by incompetent testimony,\n\n                                             \"- be it so much As makes it light, or heavy, in the substance or the division of the twentieth part of one poor scruple,\" \n\nthen we have a right to complain.\n\nLewis W. Clark, attorney-general, in reply.\n\nFor all the legal purposes of this case the charge is unexceptionable, because there is no question before this court in regard to its correctness.\n\nTHE TESTIMONY OF JULIENNE ROUSSE.\n\nI. The defendant contends that the question is not whether this evidence is admissible for any purpose, but whether there is any purpose for which it is not admissible, and that the judgment should be reversed because this evidence is not competent to show that he killed the deceased. His claim is, that evidence of the degree of guilt should be excluded, unless it tends to prove every other part of the case; that evidence tending to show a homicide, \"committed in perpetrating or attempting to perpetrate arson, rape, robbery, or burglary,\" is incompetent, unless it also tends to  show that the defendant is the murderer; that when a murder is committed in the perpetration of arson, robbery, or burglary, evidence of a fire set, a pocket-book left open and empty in the highway, or a door or lock broken, is inadmissible if it does not bear upon every question into which the general issue may by ingenuity be divided; &#8212; in short, that no evidence is admissible on any point unless it tends to prove every other point. I do not think I should be justified in occupying the time of the court with any answer to this part of the defendant's argument.\n\nII. The defendant contends that the evidence was inadmissible, because no actual proof of a raping intent was made essential by any allegations or answer in pleading or proof; that the act of killing being fixed upon the defendant, his crime, without other proof of intent, would be murder of the first degree. Under the decision in State v. Pike,  49 N.H. 399 ,  404 ,  405 , 406 , it was not necessary to allege in this indictment the defendant's perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate, a rape. But, in order to convict the defendant of murder in the first degree, it was as necessary for the State to prove that degree of murder as if it had been necessary to allege it in the terms in which it is described in the statute. The first degree is no more presumed without proof of it, than a lower degree or a mere homicide without proof of it. State v. Bartlett,  43 N.H. 224 ; State v. Jones,  50 N.H. 369 ; State v. Hodge,  50 N.H. 510 ,  525 ,  526 . The English presumption (accepted by the majority of the court in Com. v. York), that all homicide is malicious, is an error of old barbarous or semi-barbarous times not adopted here.\n\n\"Homicide may be lawful. It is well known to be so in many cases. In many more it is excusable or capable of extenuation; and if it may be so, if it often is so, whence the reason, where the justice, of attaching to that which may be lawful an inference of law that it is unlawful, and not only unlawful, but unlawful in the highest degree, &#8212; or murder? Why does not the presumption of innocence attach as much to the motive, the intent with which an act is done, as to the act itself? Innocence means innocent of any unlawful act, as well as of any act at all. If the burden of proving the act itself is on the government throughout, is there not the same burden of proving the malicious intent? It is an evasion of the point to say that the latter is proved, because it is by law inferred from the wrongful act itself. That assumes the very question in dispute. Was the homicide unlawful? The government asserts it; the accused denies it. The principle, that malice is to be legally inferred from the commission of a \"wrongful act done intentionally without just cause or excuse,\" does not help us in the solution of the question. The questions still remain, Was the homicide wrongful? Was it intentional or accidental? Was it done without just cause or excuse ? In other cases, criminal malice is not always implied from the commission of a wrongful act. In many states it is made a crime maliciously to destroy or injure another's personal property; yet it is perfectly well settled that such an offence is not made out by simple proof of a voluntary and wrongful injury to or destruction of such property. There must be proof of actual malice. 1 Bennett  Heard L. C. C. 361 (2d ed.).\n\nA legal presumption, that all homicides are malicious, could be based on nothing but the fact that homicides are generally malicious. But the fact is, that not one in a thousand is malicious in the legal sense, &#8212; i. e., criminally malicious. Compare all the murders of Europe during the last hundred years with the number of deaths caused by the lawful orders of the first Napoleon. How long a time would be necessary\nto find as many persons murdered in this country as were lawfully slain in Virginia in 1864? War is not an exception. We are at war now, and have been nearly all the time since the first settlement of the country. War is, or is law presumed to be, nothing but self-defence &#8212; a defence of rights which men may legally defend. Whether the right of defence be exercised by an organized community or by a single member of it; whether military powers join battle, or sheriffs inflict capital punishment, or rioters are shot, or other persons resisting authority are killed, or individuals take life for the prevention of atrocious crimes which cannot otherwise be prevented; whether homicide is committed under unavoidable necessity in the defence of private rights or the advancement of public justice, &#8212; the principle is the same. And when so small a portion of homicides are unlawful, what ground is there for presuming them all unlawful?\n\nLeave the military and the official destruction of life out of the account, and consider only private homicides. Many of them are so clearly lawful that they are never brought to the notice of a grand jury. And, when indictments are found, in how small a portion are there convictions of murder in the second degree; and how much smaller a portion are adjudged to be of the first degree. Vice and villany of all kinds and degrees abound; but a legal presumption that all homicide is capital crime, would be a gross violation of truth, and a cruel oppression of the accused.\n\nOur juries are always instructed that they cannot find the defendant guilty of the first degree of murder, unless they are satisfied by the evidence, beyond all reasonable doubt, that the defendant killed the deceased \"by poison, starving, torture, or other deliberate and premeditated killing, or in perpetrating or attempting to perpetrate arson, rape, robbery, or burglary.\" In this case, the state undertook to comply with that requirement, in the first place, by proving, by other evidence than that of Julienne Rousse, that the defendant assaulted and killed the deceased; and, in the second place, by proving by a variety of evidence, including that of Julienne Rousse, that his assault upon the deceased was made with a raping intent. The defendant objects to evidence as unnecessary which tends to prove one of the intents necessary to the first degree. On the question of degree, the court tell the jury that the burden of proof is on the state, and they must be satisfied by the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt: the defendant asks that the verdict be set aside, because evidence was admitted to prove that point without proof of which his execution would be a judicial murder. The exclusion of evidence of intent would be the repeal of an elementary principle, and the sacrifice of a vital right of every person on trial for his life. From seeking such a subversion of law and justice, a convict is not deterred by its shocking inhumanity.\n\nIII. The defendant proposes the introduction of a distinction between \"a mere incident\" and \"an element or the burden of the evidence.\" Such an amendment of the law would be an exceedingly attenuated\nrefinement of legal language, and a perversion of legal principle. Proof of intent, motive, malice, or any mental condition, is competent when the intent, motive, malice, or mental condition is a fact material in the case; and when such a fact is material, the proposed distinction between incident and element is immaterial.\n\nIV. The defendant admits (what no lawyer would think of denying) that when the \"quo animo becomes an essential factor in the problem of guilt or innocence to be solved,\" \"such evidence of other like acts may be competent.\" What fact in this case is a more \"essential factor,\" a more relevant and material fact, than the animus, the intent, with which the defendant assaulted the deceased? At the trial, the question of that intent was for him an issue of life or death; and so it is now, and will be while this case remains in the hands of a human tribunal. His life depends on that intent. And in what sense would language be used, if it were said that a fact upon which the law makes his life depend is immaterial. His intent is as material as his life, which is the only thing against which the judgment runs, and against which the judgment would not run if the intent had not been proved at the trial.\n\nIn a great number of the decided cases in which evidence of the intent with which other similar acts were committed has been held competent, the defendant claims the intent was \"peculiarly material.\" \"In such cases,\" he says, \"the intent is always material to be proven.\" Intent is either material or immaterial; and its materiality is a legal question. But, in admitting and rejecting evidence, the law does not proceed upon a distinction between evidence that is and evidence that is not \"peculiarly material.\" And if there were a rule of evidence based on such an indeterminate distinction, what would be more \"peculiarly material\" in the defendant's case, than an intent which is decisive of the question whether he shall live or die?\n\nThe defendant admits that when the criminality of an act depends upon the intent with which the act is done, the intent \"may well be learned from other acts of the same kind.\" Homicide may be lawful; it may be unlawful; it may be a crime; it may be a moral and legal duty. Its character depends upon the occasion, the circumstances, and the intent. Of itself, it is as indifferent as any other act the guilt of which consists in intent. 4 Bl. Com. 176-188. If the defendant killed the deceased accidentally, and without fault, he is innocent. If he killed her in the necessary defence of his child, his act was meritorious. His raping intent may be proved because it is material. It must be proved in order to convict him of a capital crime. If it had not been proved, I should have moved to set aside the verdict as a murderous mistake.\n\nV. The defendant says, &#8212; \"Courts have no discretion in admitting or rejecting legal testimony,\" and \"hanging ought not to go by discretion.\"\nIn the bill of exceptions, the court, transferring \"all questions as to the exercise of discretion,\" evidently used the word \"discretion\" in the technical sense in which it is used in legal decisions and arguments. Judicial discretion is \"the exercise of final judgment by the court in the decision of such questions of fact as, from their nature and the circumstances of the case, come peculiarly within the province of the presiding judge to determine.\" Bundy v. Hyde,  50 N.H. 116 ,  120 . \"Judicial discretion, in its technical, legal sense, is the name of the decision of certain questions of fact by the court.\" Darling v. Westmoreland, 52 N.H. 401 ,  408 . \"No doubt there would be some limits as to time and circumstances beyond which evidence of uttering forged instruments on other occasions would not be permitted. What these limits are, it is for the judge in his discretion to determine.\" Roscoe Crim. Ev. 95 (7th ed.) \"In regard to the distance of time (or place) between the principal fact in issue and the collateral facts proposed to be shown in proof of the intention, so far as it affects the admissibility of the evidence no precise rule has been laid down, but the question rests in the discretion of the judge.\" 3 Gr. Ev., sec. 15, and authorities cited in my former brief.\n\nVI. The competency of evidence of intent is not affected by the distinction between offences that are and those that are not capital. When there were one hundred and sixty capital crimes, the question was not what offences were, but what were not capital. Passing counterfeit money (third offence), trifling embezzlements by servants, insignificant thefts, and a great variety of petty delinquencies, as well as forgery, arson, robbery, burglary, c., were punished by death. 1 Montague on Punishment 82. The legislative reduction of the penalty is no reason for a judicial alteration of the rules of evidence increasing the difficulty of proving the criminal intent.\n\nVII. In Shaffner v. Com., 72 Pa. St. 60 (a case upon which the defendant relies), the judgment was reversed on the ground that the evidence of the defendant's having poisoned Sharlock was received as evidence that he poisoned his own wife Nancy. \"In substance,\" say the court, \"this was an offer to show that the prisoner poisoned Sharlock, as evidence that he also poisoned his own wife.\" It was held that there was no evidence of the defendant's previous purpose to marry Sharlock's wife Susan. The court say, &#8212; \"The previous purpose to marry Susan is the broken link in the chain to complete the connection, without which the deaths of both are not so probably connected as to make Sharlock's death evidence on the trial for the death of Nancy.\" If that decision were in point in this case, I should insist that the adulterous intercourse between the defendant and Susan, and Sharlock's life insurance money, obtained by the defendant, left no such broken link; and that the decision was reached by weighing the evidence and drawing an inference of fact which could not be drawn by a court of law passing upon the legal question. But that decision has no bearing on the competency\nof proof of intent. The only question considered in relation to the competency of evidence was, whether the act of poisoning Sharlock tended to prove the act of poisoning Nancy. The jury were instructed that \"if the prisoner is guilty at all, there can be no difficulty in ascertaining the degree of guilt, for, being by poison, it must necessarily be murder of the first degree, if purposely administered;\" &#8212; and that instruction was held right. The reversal of the judgment was based on a supposed broken link in the chain necessary to the inference of one act from another, and not on a violation of the rule that allows the intent of one act to be inferred from the intent of a similar distinct act, &#8212; a rule which the court, in State v. Renton,  15 N.H. 169 ,  175 , expressly declared they did not infringe.\n\nVIII. When the defendant says, \"No claim is made that the evidence helps to find intent only in so far forth as it helps to find a bent of mind or inclination to commit that kind of crimes,\" he misapprehends the argument which I endeavored to present in my former brief. The State claims that it is settled by all the authorities, and admitted by the defendant, that when the intent with which the defendant's act was done, or the intent with which he had possession of a person or thing, is a material part of a crime charged against him, evidence is admissible to show the intent of his acts on other occasions. The State claims that a raping intent is a material part of the crime charged against this defendant; that, under the circumstances of this case, without proof of such an intent, he could not be and ought not to be convicted of the first degree of murder; and that, under the specific instructions given by the court, the jury found, on other evidence than that of Julienne Rousse, that the defendant killed Josie Langmaid. With that verdict, the facts stated in the bill of exceptions show that he killed her, not by poison or starving, but by seizing her, taking possession of her, and making an assault upon her; and the State claims that, as matter of law, the intent with which he seized, took possession of, and assaulted other young women, is evidence of the intent with which he seized, took possession of, and assaulted this victim. Whether the fact that he assaulted, killed, or had sexual intercourse with others, is evidence that he committed a like act upon the deceased, is not a question here. For the purposes of this case, let it be as well settled as the defendant may have reason to wish, that the fact of his having committed a certain act upon others, and his general disposition to commit such an act, are not legal evidence that he committed a similar act upon the deceased. It is equally well settled that his intent, in one act or possession, is evidence of his intent in another similar act or possession. The defendant admits that the law is so when the intent is peculiarly material. And if his intent, in this case, is not peculiarly material, there is no imaginable case in which it would be. Mere intent to kill is not criminal; and when a homicidal intent acquires a criminal character from the occasion, the circumstances, or the motive, it does not carry homicide to the highest degree of guilt, except in the\nfew cases specified in the statute. The defendant's intent to kill the deceased is not the gist of the capital offence of which he has been convicted. His raping intent is the fatal fact. To be fatal, it must be proved. The methods of proving it are prescribed by the general rules relating to intent, and not by those relating to acts.\n\nThere is no inconsistency when the law admits the special and peculiar intent of other similar acts of the defendant on other occasions as evidence of his intent in the act in question, and does not admit such other acts as evidence of the alleged act. In the former case, it may fairly be inferred that his similar acts on different occasions were done with like intent, though without any unity or continuity of plot. In the latter case, it would be a very different thing to infer an act on one occasion from his commission of similar acts on other occasions, without anything to show that they all came within one settled plan and fixed purpose. If a child &#8212; yours or mine &#8212; should mysteriously disappear, we might not think that the abduction of Charlie Ross tended to show that both children had been taken by the same person. But if the kidnapper of the Ross boy were proved to have taken yours or mine, and the question were with what intent he made the seizure, would anybody doubt that his proved intent to extort a ransom from Mr. Ross tended to show an intent to rob you or me in the same manner? What difference is there in the principles of evidence applicable to such cases, whether the victims are of one sex or the other, whether the alleged intent of the brigand is to make money by extorting ransoms from parents or by sending captives into slavery, as in Com. v. Turner, or to gratify some other passion than avarice, as in this case and in State v. Evans?\n\nThe intent of one act may be inferred from the intent of other similar acts, though the one act may not be inferred from the others. If it be said that the legal difference between such inferences is a mere difference in their strength, my answer is, that the law permits the stronger of the two, and does not permit the other to be drawn; and that my business here is to contend for the law as it is, and not to argue the question whether the law ought to be so changed as to tolerate both inferences or prohibit both.\n\nThe rule, which (with various qualifications and exceptions) forbid one act to be inferred from other similar acts, or (what is the same thing) from a general disposition, inclination, or tendency to commit such acts, is found only in that small part of the world where the common law prevails. As suggested in Darling v. Westmoreland, pp. 407, 408, this peculiarity of English law may have been a piece of judicial legislation in mitigation of the undiscriminating and merciless severity of a criminal code of one hundred and sixty capital offences. But I do not invite the court to investigate the origin of that rule; I do not argue that the reason of it has ceased, and that it is not adapted to a criminal code of a solitary capital offence; I do not ask the court to reject it on that or any other ground: but I do insist that, in our humane code, in the increase of crime, the new perils of the defenceless,\nthe panic of parents, and the terror that reigns in many other places as well as on academy roads, in the constant obstruction and frequent defeat of justice by mistaken pity, sentimental influences, the general relaxation of principle, demoralization of society, and decay of government, there is nothing that can induce the court to wish they had the power to change the law by excluding the defendant's intent in one act on the question of his intent in another similar act. How fearfully such a change would cripple the arm of justice, and endanger private rights of person, reputation, and property, they who have been engaged in the administration of the criminal law well know. We need all the just, reasonable, and efficient means now available for detecting, convicting, and punishing the lawless, and restraining the elements of society that are hostile to its welfare. No competent evidence can be spared. An inference as to the defendant's intent in one act, may be drawn from his intent in other similar acts. That rule cannot be safely annulled. I contend for it, as law, imperatively required by reason and justice, indisputably established by the authorities, and explicitly admitted by the defendant; and I anxiously hope that my successors may not be disabled in the performance of their duties by the abolition of a rule so necessary for the protection of the community.\n\n  [fn*]  In the trial of Mr. Hawkins, a clergyman. for stealing money and a ring from Henry Larimore in September, 1668, Lord HALE admitted evidence to show he had once stolen a pair of boots from a man called Chilton, and that, more than a year before, he had picked the pockets of one noble.

Another part of her body, including one half or two thirds of the vagina, was cut out and carried away, and\nwas never recovered. No post-mortem examination of the body was made, with a view to ascertaining whether the victim had been violated.\n\nThe government claimed that the murder was committed \"in perpetrating or attempting to perpetrate rape.\"\n\nAs tending to show that the prisoner had an intent to commit such a crime, and that he was making antecedent preparations therefor, the state was permitted to show, by one Clarence B. Cochran, that on October 1, about half past eight o'clock in the morning, as he was passing along the Academy road on his way to school, when he arrived within about thirty rods of the place of the murder, he saw a man jump into the bushes on the side of the road. He testified: \"I only saw him pass into the bushes. He passed into the bushes, springing, as if in haste.\" He did not recognize the man.\n\nAdin G. Fowler was permitted to testify to conversations with the respondent, on September 24, 25, and 26, as follows: I was to work out in front of the house on that night [September 24] sorting potatoes. Mr. Lapage came out and took hold and helped us for a few moments; and while we were to work there my sister came home. A gentleman brought her home, and she got out of the wagon and went into the house; and Mr. Lapage wanted to know who that was, and I told him; and he wanted to know then if she had been to Suncook. I told him no, she had been to school. Then he wanted to know which way she went to get there, and I told him, as well as I could, how to go, and pointed out toward the academy, that way (pointing), and he said that that must be the same way that he came when he came out to Mr. Kimball's; and that was all that was said that night.\n\n*    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *   *\n\nThe next night Saturday night &#8212; I went to carry him part of the way home. I carried him down Buck street as far as the house of Mr. Locke, and when we got down to Russ's corner he wanted to know then if there is where my sister went to school. I told him no, and pointed out toward the academy again, and told him two miles, or a mile and a half &#8212; I don't remember exactly, but I believe I told him a mile &#8212; \"and then turn to your right and go up.\" And that was all that was said that night.\n\n*    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *\n\nSaturday I carried my sister on the street, and left her there at a place where she roomed.

When we went past there [the Academy road] I remember of telling him that that is the road my sister went on when she went to school.\"\n\nEdward L. Mahair testified that he saw the respondent while he was at work for Mr. Fowler, threshing. While thus occupied, about a week before the murder, a young lady passed by.\n\n*    *    *    *    *   *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *\n\nWhen the girl passed by he was threshing in the barn, and he spoke to me and asked me where that gal was going. I told him I\ndidn't know. Then he asked me what her name was. I told him her name was Sarah Prentice. Then he wanted to know where she lived. I told him &#8212; went to the door, and showed him as near as I could. *  * Then he wanted to know who was going with her. I told him I didn't know. And that is all he said that day. *  * I was up there the next day, and was going through the barn, and he stopped me, and said, \"Where did that gal go that went down by?\" I told him I didn't know whether she went into Mr. Fowler's or went further. The wanted to know who went with her. I told him I couldn't tell him; I didn't know who went with her. Then he asked me who she was and where she lived, again, and I showed him; and then the next time he asked me who went with her, I told him I didn't know. He said he wondered which road she went on the most. I told him\n\n\"I guess she goes on this road the most.\"\n\nThe witness then repeated an obscene and vulgar remark and inquiry made by the respondent concerning the girl.\n\nHiram Towle, and Harriet. A. N. Towle, his wife, testified, in substance, that on Saturday, October second, about nine o'clock A. M., they were riding over the Academy road, and when about fifty or sixty rods from the place of the murder they met the respondent carrying a stick behind him. The stick was described as being similar in all respects (about three feet long, four-sided, about one and a quarter inches square, whittled at one end for a handle) to a stick produced in court, which had been found, broken and stained with blood, near the place of the murder.\n\nAlversia Watson testified as follows: I live in Allenstown. Have a son and two daughters; my youngest daughter is attending school at Pembroke academy; did not attend school last fall, but taught in Hooksett; I go over Chester turnpike to get there; she came home Friday nights, and went back Sundays; first part of term she walked; I went with her &#8212; generally went about a mile and three quarters. Saw Lapage on that road once, in the last part of September, on Sunday; saw him standing about a mile from my house beside the road, opposite some bushes; my daughter was with me; noticed nothing in his hands when I first saw him. Saw him again about half a mile further on; he was coming towards me; this was two weeks before I heard of the murder; he had something in his hand the second time I saw him; it was a stick, or cane; think that the stick was a newly cut stick; think it was larger than the stick found in the woods of the murder; had it in his right hand. The second time I saw him he was coming along behind me, about a hundred feet; I watched him by looking behind me; was about twelve feet away when I last saw him; he was moving rapidly toward me, partly running; my daughter was very much frightened, and was crying; it was between four and five in the afternoon when I saw him the first time; saw him next time half a mile further on in the road, following on after me; had been walking; turning to look at my daughter, saw a man picking berries on top of a hill; when I turned to look at my daughter, saw Lapage going into\nthe bushes; went about half a mile further with my daughter; sat on top of the hill till I thought my daughter had got out of hearing &#8212; about fifteen minutes, I think; George Mack [the man who was picking berries] waited, and came home with me. The person I met with a club was Lapage, the prisoner.\n\nCross-examination. My daughter and I were going to Hooksett; it was on Sunday; it is four miles from my house to where she taught school; went with her about two miles; there are chestnut woods along the road; first saw the man about a mile from home, he was just outside of the road; he was about fifty feet away then, standing still; did not see him again until I had passed the place, and turned back and saw him again; he stood still till I passed out of his sight by a turn in the road; it was two or three minutes' walk before I got out of sight of him; went with my daughter more than a mile; went nearly half a mile before I saw him again; he was coming in the road; could have seen a man quite a little distance; when I saw him last he was partly running towards me, and came to within a few feet of me; saw the man picking berries there, near Lakin's shanty, a short distance away; saw no one else but Mr. Mack's little boy; the man with the stick went into the woods on the opposite side from where Mr. Mack was. The man I saw was not very tall, with black whiskers, tan-colored overalls, and gray mixed coat. Wore a dark hat. Next saw the man in jail; can't tell when; went there at the request of Mr. Hildreth; he mentioned no name of any one at the jail, but wished me to go and see if there was any one there that I had seen before. Mr. Hildreth, Hattie Gault, and some others went to the jail with me; Mr. Sargent asked me to go and look in every cell and see if there was any one that I had seen there; went in, and when I saw Lapage, knew him at once by his looks and features; did not notice Lapage's moustache when I met him in the road; don't think his beard was as long in jail as when I saw him in the road.\n\nRe-direct. My attention was called to some clothing at the jail, and I picked out a coat that I thought was like the one he wore. [Coat shown, and thought to be the same by witness.]\n\nMatthias Mercy testified as follows: I know Annie Watson; saw her on Chester turnpike one Sunday last September; saw her about two and a half or three miles from Suncook saw-mill; was in the road when I met her; had not seen her before; said nothing to her; sat down on a rock beside the road; saw Lapage while I sat there; I knew Lapage before; he was running towards the girl; when he came up to me he faced towards me; his face was red and excited; he had been running half a mile, and more too; he never said anything to me; he looked right towards her; he slacked up a little, and then started off on a run; don't know whether he saw me or not.\n\nCross-examined. I had seen Lapage before I saw him in the road; saw him in his house in Potter's block; saw him in the road on Sunday &#8212; the last Sunday in the month; saw a man and woman that day; their names were Palmer; they live in Allenstown; saw them when I was going up, and the girl\nwhen I came back; went up as far as Lakin's hill, turned, and came back; it is about two miles from Suncook to Lakin's hill; saw Lapage as I was coming back from Lakin's, about five o'clock at night; met the Watson girl the other side of Lakin's hill; I walked about a quarter of a mile and sat down; heard Lapage running in half a minute; saw Lapage walk up the hill, and begin to run when he reached the top; this was after he passed me.\n\nAnna A. Watson testified that she was the daughter of Mrs. A. Watson, and taught school in Hooksett last September; came home Friday nights and returned Sunday nights, usually. On Sunday night, a fortnight before Josie Langmaid was killed on Monday, she met two persons on the road; met T. Marcy on the road; she and her mother were followed by a man that Sunday; he was in the bushes, partly bent over, and she noticed he had dark whiskers. As they were going up the hill by a shanty she looked back and saw the man again, coming after her, some ways from where she first saw him, and he was on the side of the road, as near as across this room; he had a stick in his hands, travelling fast; he was walking, and he nearly overtook us. She was so frightened that she thought she would go up the hill as soon as possible, and in a few minutes she saw Mr. Mack; the man disappeared in the woods, and she did not see the man; he went into the woods again; after her mother left her she ran; she could not identify the man, she was so frightened at the time.\n\nJulienne Rousse testified that she resided in Joliet, Canada, and was a sister of Joseph Lapage's wife, and knew him; saw him last four years ago last June, before seeing him in Concord; saw him at her home in Desier Marion.\n\nWent to a pasture to milk cows while living at St. Beatrice, Canada, and met Lapage there; when I arrived at the pasture the cows were not there; Lapage was above in the pasture, with a buffalo robe mask on his face, a home-made faded red shirt, and pair of linen pants, with a leather belt around him, and a pine root in his hand the size of her arm, and about three feet long; he was four or five rails from her. A rail is ten feet; the place was not in sight of any house; it was seven o'clock in the morning, June, 1871; he tried to catch her; she shouted and tried to run away; after she had gone four or five rails he overtook her, caught hold of her, and she turned round and pulled the mask off of him and recognized Lapage by his face; he then rolled his head into her skirt and tried to choke her. After he choked her she turned on her belly, and then he rubbed coarse sand into her eyes and mouth; after she was choked and lost her strength he outraged her; lost her strength and mind, and did not know when he left her; she was gone two hours before she reached the house, which was ten acres away, or about one third of a mile; he did not strike her with the stick, but committed rape upon her; after coming to, she went to her home. He choked her throat with his hand, which left black marks upon her throat. The marks were upon her throat for a month, and her neck was very black where his fingers were, and for a month she\nhad great difficulty in eating and drinking; was twenty-seven years old, and never married; Lapage was married at that time, and lived twenty-five or thirty acres from her home; saw Lapage the next day, but had no conversation with him; was living with a Mr. Marion then; had never seen or spoken to him since; he went to the United States at once.\n\nCross-examined. First talked of the outrage upon her to Joseph Lajeunnesse and his daughter, the same day at nine o'clock, they being at Marion's house at the time. Three children of Marion, the oldest seven years old, and Lajeunnesse's family, were the only ones in the house; couldn't tell where the Lajeunnesse family now lived, except that it was in a place called Acton; they left St. Beatrice three years next March, she thought; next talked of the outrage with Mr. Marion and his wife, at three o'clock the same afternoon; employed no doctor for her injuries; Lapage first seized her by her throat. After she was down on the ground, he grabbed her by the back to throw her down, and attempted to commit the outrage, when she screamed, and he seized her throat. He turned her over after he choked her, and this was after the sand was put into her eyes and mouth, at which time she was sensible; but she lost her senses when he committed the outrage, and did not know when she recovered her senses, but was gone two hours before she got back to the house. She pulled the mask off so far as to see his eyes, and she knew the man before she pulled the mask from him. The mask was tied with two black strings, and she pulled it down so she saw his forehead; had a hat on when she first saw him, and when she grabbed his mask his hat fell off. He tried to murmur a few words of English, so as to disguise himself. She understood that Lapage knew that she knew him, and so tried to disguise himself by attempting to talk English. She had no talk with him, but screamed; Lapage had a farm, and worked on it, which belonged to Edward Perrault. Spoke to Edward Perrault about the outrage upon her. She asked him if Lapage was at home, and he said he was not, but had started for the states. She never said to Perrault that she did not know who it was that assaulted her, and had no conversation with him about the outrage.\n\nTo the admission of all the foregoing testimony the respondent excepted.\n\nHattie M. Gault testified as follow: Lived on Pembroke street, a half mile this side of the academy, and attended that school October 4, and reached the school about 8.30 [8:30] that morning; bells rung at 8.25 [8:25] and 8.55 [8:55] o'clock; stood in the door of the academy and saw Lapage past the building, and was as confident of it as she could be; he had an axe on his shoulder, and turned down the Academy road, and she watched him as far as she could see him on that road. Next saw him at the jail, and identified him as the man who passed the academy.\n\nConcerning the foregoing evidence, the court charged the jury as follows:\n\n\"You have heard the testimony of Julienne Rousse to the effect that\nin June, 1871, this prisoner committed a rape upon her. In considering this evidence (if you believe the witness, you will be required to use careful discrimination of the was and manner in which it is to be applied to this case, if it is to be applied at all.\n\n\"We have admitted the evidence, not because it is necessarily connected with the issue which you are to try, &#8212; which is, the guilt or the innocence of the prisoner of the offence with which he is here and now charged, &#8212; but because it may have a legal bearing upon that issue in the way which I shall endeavor to explain, and to which I invite your most careful attention. It may he your duty to reject the evidence entirely, and put it out of the case, and out of your minds. It may be your duty to consider it. It is a fundamental principle or law, that evidence that a defendant committed one offence cannot be received to prove that he committed another and distinct offence. This principle we must take care not to violate. And, therefore, you are not to regard the evidence of Julienne Rousse as any proof or evidence that the prisoner killed Josie Langmaid. Therefore, unless you find from other evidence, entirely independent of that of Julienne Rousse, that the prisoner killed and murdered Josie Langmaid, you must reject her evidence altogether.\n\n\"The evidence is open to your consideration, if at all, only so far as it may seem to you to bear upon the character of the homicide of Josie Langmaid; only as it may bear upon the question whether she was murdered by the prisoner in perpetrating or attempting to perpetrate rape.\n\n\"Our statute declares that `All murder committed by poison, starving, torture, or other deliberate and premeditated killing, or committed in attempting to perpetrate arson, rape, robbery, or burglary, is murder of the first degree; and all murder not of the first degree, is murder of the second degree.'\n\n\"And if the jury shall find any prisoner guilty of murder, they shall by their verdict find also whether it is of the first or second degree.'\n\n\"If you find, from other evidence in the case than that of Julienne Rousse, that the defendant killed Josie Langmaid deliberately and premeditatedly, or in perpetrating or attempting to perpetrate rape, you may and your duty is to reject her testimony altogether. But if you are not so satisfied by all the other evidence and circumstances of the case, you may consider her evidence. I need hardly say that you must be satisfied upon this point, that the prisoner is the man who committed the rape upon Julienne Rousse.\n\n\"The evidence you see, therefore, bears only upon the question of the intention of the prisoner in killing Josie Langmaid, and thus upon the degree of guilt, i. e., whether the offence is murder of the first or second degree.\n\n\"Now, `the unlawful intent in a particular case may sometimes be inferred [not necessarily, but it may be inferred] from a similar intent proved to he existed in previous transactions'\n\n\"The principle upon which such evidence is admitted is, that,\n`though the prisoner is not to be prejudiced in the eyes of the jury by the needless admission of testimony tending to prove another crime, yet, wherever the evidence which tends to prove the other crime tends also to prove this one, not merely by showing the prisoner to be a bad man, but by showing the particular bad intent to have existed in his mind at the time when he did the act complained of, it is admissible.'\n\n\"If, in this case, you find it necessary to show the commission of, or the attempt to commit, a rape upon Josie Langmaid, in order to find the prisoner guilty of murder in the first degree, and the evidence of the mutilation and concealment of the private parts of her body are not sufficient to satisfy you of that fact, then you may inquire what other motive induced him to kill her.\n\n\"Does the testimony of Julienne Rousse, or any other evidence in the case, tend to show the existence in the mind of the prisoner of a motive or passion which would render the commission of or an attempt to commit, a rape upon Josie Langmaid more probable than it would otherwise seem to you? Does it or not tend to show that such a lustful intent existed in the heart of the prisoner at the time as would render the commission of a rape more probable? Does this evidence supply a motive for the commission of the offence?\n\n\"The crime committed upon Julienne Rousse was four years and more antecedent to the offence under consideration. Since that time a change may have taken place in his mind. There has been time for repentance; and the lustful disposition he bore then may have been eradicated. The more remote the evidence of this mental condition, the less force and weight belong to it.\n\n\"But in connection with this part of your inquiry, i. e., concerning the present intention, and whether a lustful disposition still remained in the prisoner's heart, you may consider the evidence of Adin G. Fowler, of the prisoner's inquiry on three different occasions concerning Fowler's sister, and where she went to school and the road she took to get there (within a fortnight of the murder); of young Mahair concerning Sarah Prentice &#8212; the way she travelled, and the obscene remark concerning her; of Mrs. Watson, her daughter Anna and Matthias Mercy, concerning his pursuit of Anna, about two weeks before the murder.\n\n\"And here it is proper to remark, that if the prisoner killed Josie Langmaid, it is not at all necessary that any lustful desire or any animosity toward her in particular should be shown provided she became the victim of his lustful and murderous intent. If the intent to commit rape and murder upon some one else or upon any girl whom by chance he might encounter, was consummated in an attack upon Josie Langmaid, the indictment is sustained.\"\n\nNo exceptions were taken to the charge.\n\nThe respondent was convicted of murder in the first degree, and sentenced to be hanged.\n\nThe respondent tendered this bill of exceptions, which was allowed; and, in transferring the same for the consideration of the superior\ncourt, the circuit court reserved and transferred all questions as to the exercise of discretion.

{"absolute_url": "/opinion/3575326/state-ex-rel-pearson-v-hayes/", "attorney": "Bingham  Mitchell, for the plaintiff. In this case, we contend that there is &#8212; after eliminating from it all questions which are irrelevant and immaterial to the real issue &#8212; but a single question, viz., Does the defendant legally hold a directorship in the Concord Railroad Corporation: was he legally elected? In other words, Did John H. Pearson receive, at the meeting of the corporation on May 23, 1881, a sufficient number of votes to elect him director? If Mr. Pearson received a sufficient number to elect him a director, then the defendant did not get the requisite number of votes for an election, and should not have been declared elected. The shares of stock voted on and the votes cast respectively for Mr. Pearson and the defendant stand thus: There were 5,114 shares voted on for Mr. Pearson, and for him only. There were 17,981\nshares voted on for seven candidates for directors, giving one vote for each of the seven candidates, and the defendant was one of the seven. The voters upon the 5,114 shares, instead of casting on each share one vote for each of seven candidates, cast on each share seven votes for one candidate. This made 35,798 votes cast for Mr. Pearson on the 5,114 shares; and 35,798 votes being a majority of the votes cast for the candidates for the directorship in controversy, Mr. Pearson was elected to it, and the defendant was illegally declared elected. The persons who voted upon the 5,114 shares, and cast 36,798 votes for the relator, cumulated their votes in accordance with the provisions of the following act of the legislature: \"In all elections for directors or managers of a corporation, each member or shareholder may cast the whole number of his votes for one candidate, or distribute them upon two or more candidates, as he may prefer.\" Laws of 1879, C. 54, s. 1.\n\nW. P. Wilson (of Massachusetts), for the defendant. The respondent denies that the relator was entitled to have the 5,114 votes cast for him multiplied by the number of directors to be chosen, because he contends, &#8212;\n\n1. That the statute was unconstitutional, inasmuch as it was not a direct legislative enactment, but was an attempted delegation of legislative authority.\n\n2. That the statute, if constitutional, did not confer the power contended for by the relator.\n\nThe principle contended for by the respondent, namely, that since the supreme legislative power is vested in the general court of New Hampshire (Const. N.H. II., ss. 2, 3) it cannot be delegated to others, is well recognized in all the adjudications. Thorne v. Cramer, 15 Barb. 112; Cooley Const. Lim. (4th ed.) 141; Sedgwick Const. Law 164; Seneca Bank v. Lamb, 26 Barb. 595. All authority is inherent in the people, and they are the original sovereigns. But when they invest a given body or person with any portion of this supreme authority, as, for instance, with the authority to make laws, or with the executive, administrative, or judicial authority, they divest themselves of such power, and they cannot resume it unless the power of resumption be expressly reserved in the constatory instrument. State v. Morris Co., 7 Vroom 72. Nor can such power be delegated by such bodies or persons to others, since the maxim, delegata potestas non potest delegari, applies equally to the delegation of public and private authority. And upon another ground it seems that the legislative body cannot delegate this authority, since the people depend not only upon their legislators to pass and engross laws, but also upon their integrity, knowledge, and judgment; and it is for the legislators to decide upon the expediency as well as forms of the law, i.e., it is a discretionary trust, so that, if the delegation of a discretionary private trust be void, a fortiori should it be so in the case of a public\ntrust. Could the legislature delegate this authority, it would avoid all responsibility for its acts, and it would be able to invest a person or body with the entire legislative power (State v. Field,  17 Mo. 529 ); and the object of the people in creating a legislature would be entirely frustrated, as it would cease to be a representative body, and would become a mere proposer of laws for the consideration and final action of some third person or body. And this result is not an imaginary evil, since it actually occurred in Indiana, and the people were compelled to provide, by constitutional amendment, that no law should be passed, the taking effect of which should be made to depend upon any authority except as provided in the constitution. Maize v. State,  4 Ind. 342 .\n\nMoreover, as an act can be repealed only by the power creating it, one legislature would be able to encroach upon the privileges and limit the authority of all succeeding legislatures. Santo v. State,  2 Iowa 165 . But an act is unconstitutional which limits the authority of any subsequent legislature. Philadelphia v. Fox, 64 Penn. St. 169.\n\nIt may be contended, however, that to allow the people to decide whether a proposed enactment shall or shall not become a law is in accord with the principles of our democratic government, and is the method frequently adopted in submitting constitutional amendments to the people. In reply, it may be said that our democracy is not a pure democracy, like the government of Athens, but is a representative democracy; and, secondly, that the legislatures have no inherent power to frame a constitutional provision and leave it to the people for confirmation; &#8212; so that, if a legislature should do this, and the provision should be accepted, it derives its authority not from the legislature, but from the people. Opinion of the Justices, 6 Cush. 573. Therefore, if this principle be accepted, the people could enact all laws, and become the legislative power in direct violation of the constitution. Although all courts have recognized the principle that a legislature should not delegate its authority to enact laws, the difficulty has heretofore been the application of the maxim to the facts of the particular case. But it is contended that in this case no such difficulty can arise, since in the bill now before the court we have as plain all illustration of an attempt by a legislature to delegate its authority as can be desired.\n\nThat the legislature can enact a law which is to take effect upon a contingency cannot be doubted; and the rule as to such a contingency is succinctly stated in State v. Parker,  26 Vt. 357 . The right, however, to enact a law subject to a contingency is altogether different from the right to delegate authority to make laws. The cases upon this subject seem to divide themselves into three distinct groups:\n\n1. Those statutes to take effect upon a strict contingency as to time or event. Brig Aurora v. U.S., 7 Cranch 382.\n\n2. Those statutes which confer an authority or discretion as to their acceptance or execution. Railroad Co. v. Com.,  1 Ohio St. 77 .\n\n3. Those statutes which are truly a delegation of power to make a law. State v. Field,  17 Mo. 529 .\n\nThere are but few adjudications upon cases of the first class, but they are best illustrated by the enactments of congress in which a law is made to take effect or to cease upon the happening of some event or act of some government. Brig Aurora v. U.S., 7 Cranch 382. These enactments are sometimes cited as recognizing the validity of a delegation of legislative authority (State v. Parker, supra); but they are enacted under the provision of the constitution whereby congress is authorized \"to regulate commerce with foreign nations,\" so that, although they might be considered as containing a delegation of authority in some instances, yet they are enacted in pursuance to direct constitutional provision, and are sustainable upon this ground if upon no other.\n\nThe second class consists of those statutes which confer authority or discretion as to their acceptance or execution, and include, &#8212;\n\na. Those statutes which contain a grant of property or privileges conditional upon acceptance: 1. Private charter; 2. Municipal legislation.\n\nb. Those statutes creating \"local option\" laws, e. g., laws by which the sale of intoxicating liquor is made to depend upon the votes of the inhabitants.\n\na. Statutes of this kind are not regarded as being a delegation of the authority to make laws, since they do not derive their force or validity from the legislative power; i. e., they are not, strictly speaking, laws. It does not follow, that because the legislature enacts them therefore they are laws, since all acts of the legislature are not legislative acts; &#8212; for instance, the power to levy a tax, to create corporations, to coin money, to take land by right of eminent domain, or to declare war, although exercised by the legislature, is not a legislative, but a sovereign, power; i.e., these acts are performed by virtue of the sovereign power inherent in the legislature. So, too, statutes regulating municipalities are not legislative acts, but acts of sovereignty. Chandler v. Boston, 112 Mass. 200 ; Stone v. Charlestown,  114 Mass. 214 ; Com. v. Quarter Sessions, 8 Penn. St. 391. The main difference between the case of a grant to a private corporation and of one to a municipal corporation is, that in the former instance the privileges and obligations bestowed must be accepted by the corporators before they can be concluded by such grant; whereas, in the case of municipal corporations, no assent or acceptance is necessary, from the very nature of the case, to conclude the citizens, since it is an inherent attribute of the legislature to control territorial divisions of the state, and to erect, change, divide, and even abolish such municipalities as may seem best for the government of the state. Therefore\nthe legislature can change the territorial limits of such municipalities, and can limit or extend the power of taxation, the creation of debt, the establishment of highways and school-districts, and all local regulations, including the power to make by-laws and ordinances, without the consent of the inhabitants. Berlin v. Gorham,  34 N.H. 266 . The fact that an acceptance or assent, to be indicated by the votes of the electors, is required, in no wise invalidates the exercise of such power, as such assent is given qua corporators, not qua legislators. Paterson v. Society, 4 Zabr. 385. The assent is of the same nature as the grant, whether it be of a privilege conferred or obligation imposed. Railroad Co. v. Com'rs,  1 Ohio St. 77 ; State v. Wilcox,  45 Mo. 458 ; Bull v. Read, 13 Grat. 78; State v. Scott, 17 Mo. 521 ; Peck v. Weddell,  17 Ohio St. 271 ; Paterson v. Society, supra; Cheaney v. Hooser, 9 B. Mon. 339; Berlin v. Gorham, supra; Alcorn v. Hamer, 38 Miss. 652 ; Corning v. Greene, 23 Barb. 33; Morford v. Unger,  8 Iowa 82 ; Gorham v. Springfield,  21 Me. 58 ; Com. v. Quarter Sessions, supra; Com. v. Painter, 10 Penn. St. 214; Hobart v. Supervisors,  17 Cal. 23 ; Bank of Chenango v. Brown,  26 N.Y. 467 ; Smith v. McCarthy, 56 Penn. St. 359; R. R. Co. v. Geiger,  34 Ind. 185 ; State v. Linn Co.,  44 Mo. 504 ; Chandler v. Boston,  112 Mass. 200 ; Minot v. W; Roxbury,  112 Mass. 1 ; Stone v. Charlestown, supra; State v. Noyes,  30 N.H. 279 ; People v. Reynolds, 5 Gilm. 1; Hudson Co. v. State, 4 Zabr. 718; People v. Nally,  49 Cal. 478 .\n\nb. Those statutes creating local option laws. The cases under this class are numerous and conflicting, and have generally arisen when an attempt has been made to pass a general license law, allowing the electors in the several counties or towns, however, to adopt or reject it as they see fit. The question which is generally left to the people by these laws is, whether liquor shall or shall not be sold subject to license. The decisions have usually been made to turn upon the phraseology of the bill; and, those statutes which have expressly declared that no liquor shall be sold without license, but have allowed the electors to determine from time to time whether licenses should be granted, have been sustained, it being said in such cases that the statute created the vote, not the vote the statute, since the statute was complete, as a law, before reference to the people. State v. Morris Co., 7 Vroom 72; Santo v. State,  2 Iowa 165 ; People v. Collins,  3 Mich. 343 ; State v. Copeland,  3 R. I. 33 ; Locke's App., 72 Penn. St. 491; State v. Wilcox,  42 Conn. 364 . Those statutes, however, which in substance have submitted to the electors the general question whether the sale of intoxicating liquors should be licensed or not, have been considered unconstitutional. Rice v. Foster, 4 Harr. (Del.) 479; Maize v. State, supra; Meshmeier v. State.  11 Ind. 482 ; Parker v. Com., 6 Penn. St. 507; Ex parte Wall,  48 Cal. 279 . And those statutes which have allowed the people to decide whether the act prohibiting the sale should or should not become a law, or whether they would\naccept or act under such statute, have likewise been considered unconstitutional. Thorne v. Cramer, supra; People v. Stout, 23 Barb. 349; Barto v. Himrod,  8 N.Y. 483 ; Geebrick v. State,  5 Iowa 491 . But in the late cases the question of constitutionality or unconstitutionality is not made to depend upon the phraseology of the statutes; but it is held, that although the power which the municipalities have to regulate the sale of intoxicating liquors (in the municipalities) is not embraced within the ordinary power to make by-laws and ordinances, it falls within the class of police regulations; and as these regulations may be entrusted by the legislature to such municipal authority by express enactment, they may likewise be entrusted by a general enactment. Com. v. Bennett, 108 Mass. 27 ; Com. v. Dean,  110 Mass. 357 ; State v. Morris, supra; Gloversville v. Howell,  70 N.Y. 287 ; State v. Noyes, 30 N.H. 279 .\n\nBut whether \"local option\" laws are to be considered as constitutional in all cases, as deriving their authority from the sovereign power, or whether their constitutionality is to depend upon their phraseology, is not material to the construction of the statute before the court in the present instance: it is sufficient that they establish no rule which affects our case.\n\nThe third class consists of those statutes which contain a delegation of the legislative power. There are but few adjudications upon statutes of this nature; but it has been universally conceded that a statute of this nature would be unconstitutional. Santo v. State, supra; Geebrick v. State, supra; State v. Beneke,  9 Iowa 203 ; Rice v. Foster, supra; Railroad Co. v. Com'rs, supra; Parker v. Com., supra; Maize v. State, supra; Meshmeier v. State, supra; State v. Swisher,  17 Tex. 441 ; State v. Copeland, supra; Paterson v. Society, supra; Alcorn v. Hamer, supra. A statute allowing the people to decide by their votes whether it should become a law or not, has been held unconstitutional. Thorne v. Cramer, supra; Bradley v. Baxter, 15 Barb. 122; People v. Stout, supra; Barto v. Himrod, supra. A statute concerning roads and highways, certain sections of which imposed penalties and provided for their recovery by indictment, by which county courts were allowed, in their discretion, to suspend for any specified length of time the operation of the same, has likewise been held unconstitutional Gamble, J., in delivering the opinion of the court, said, &#8212; \"This act, by its own provisions, repeals the inconsistent provisions of a former act, and yet it is left to the county court to say which act shall be in force in their county. The question which is to be passed upon by the county court is, whether the new act shall be suspended and the old act revived, and if so, for how long. This bears a very strong resemblance to the exercise of legislative power by the county court.\" State v. Field, supra.\n\nIt is contended that the statute now before the court for construction is likewise a delegation of legislative authority, and therefore unconstitutional. This statute is entitled \"An act to provide\nfor minority representation in corporations.\" [Counsel here quoted the statute.] It will not be questioned, I think, that the general court, in framing these provisions, did so by virtue of its legislative and not its sovereign power, since it was the establishment of a rule, and was not in any sense a grant. It was a rule regulating the manner of voting, and is similar to a statute regulating the transfer of stock in corporations. Compare Mass. Sts., 1881, c. 302. Could the general court, then, in the exercise of its legislative power, submit a bill of this nature to the people in order to ascertain their \"sense\" concerning it? There can be no difference between this method of submitting a bill to the people, and allowing them in express terms to decide whether the bill shall or shall not become a law, or whether they will or will not be bound thereby. The form of submission is immaterial. If their \"sense\" is averse to the bill, it will not become a law.\n\nIf it is said that the contingency upon which this statute is to take effect is of the same nature as the contingency upon which the acts of congress, already noticed, are made to depend, it may be said (in addition to the distinction heretofore suggested), &#8212; first, that congress does not make the efficacy of the latter statutes depend upon the act of its constituency, but of a hostile power; i. e., congress does not make the efficacy of these enactments depend upon the act of the persons from whom it derives its authority, but upon the act of a power over which it has no control: such statutes do not act so much upon its constituency as against such hostile power; &#8212; secondly, that there is no question of discretion or will conferred thereby; therefore the contingency, though an act, is still an event: authority cannot be delegated to an event. Had the minority law been made to take effect, provided a general railroad law should at some future time be enacted, or the Lake Shore Railroad obtain a charter, such a contingency would have been lawful, it being in the nature of an event. But the gist of the contingency in the present case is not the event, but it is the sense or the will of the people as expressed by the event; and it is pernicious because it allows the constituency, in their discretion, to say what shall or what shall not be the law. When the contingency is a pure event, the law is complete when passed; the enacting body has expressed its judgment as to the expediency and the form of the law, and no other person has any discretion in the matter. In the statute now before the court it is evident that the general court did not exercise its discretion as to the expediency of this law; that it evaded the very responsibility, and failed to perform the very trusts, for which it had been constituted; that, when this bill left its hands, it was not a mandate, and had no vital force, but depended upon the will of the people to give it life. The vote created the law, therefore the vote was essentially an act of legislation. But as the people have no legislative power except it be derived from the general court, and as the general\ncourt could not delegate its legislative authority, such act is of no effect, and is unconstitutional.\n\nBut though this statute is constitutional, it does not confer the privilege claimed by the relator. Judging from the ballots cast, the stockholders voting for the relator claimed the right to multiply the number of shares they owned by the number of directors to be elected. It is quite evident, however, that the minority law does not confer this right, as it makes no mention of a multiplier or multiplicand, and it does not, in terms, increase the number of votes a stockholder may cast. Furthermore, it simply authorizes a stockholder to cumulate the whole number of his votes; but since it wholly fails to state what \"the whole number of his votes\" is, this \"number\" must be determined by the law in force when this enactment became a law. By the General Laws of New Hampshire, c. 148, s. 18, in force January 15, 1881, being a reenactment of s. 5, c. 321, of the acts of the year 1846, it is provided, &#8212; \"Every stockholder in any corporation, except banks whose charters otherwise provide, may give one vote at any meeting thereof for every share he owns therein, not exceeding one eighth part of the whole number of shares.\" Therefore one vote is the \"whole number of his votes.\" Since this statute is an abrogation of the implied, but essential, stipulation in every compact of association, that the will of the majority shall be considered the will of the entire body (Angell  Ames Corp., s. 499, Dudley v. Kentucky High School, 9 Bush. (Ky.) 576) it must be construed strictly, that is to say, the intention of the legislators must not be extended by construction, and they may be presumed to have conferred only those rights which are given in express terms. \"Cumulate,\" therefore, will not be interpreted by the court as \"multiply.\"\n\nIn Missouri and Illinois the minority law expressly provides that in all elections for directors of any incorporated company each shareholder shall have the right to cast as many votes in the aggregate as shall equal the number of shares of stock so held by him multiplied by the number of directors to be elected, and may cast the whole number of votes, either in person or by proxy, for one candidate, or distribute them among two or more candidates. It likewise provides that such directors shall not be elected in any other manner. Rev. Sts. Mo., C. 21, s. 712; Rev. Sts. Ill. (1880), c. 114, s. 26. And in Pennsylvania it is provided, &#8212; \"In all elections for directors of any corporation, each stockholder may cast the whole number of his votes for one candidate, or distribute them upon two or more candidates, as he may prefer; that is to say, if the said stockholder owns one share of stock, or has one vote, and is entitled to one vote for each of six directors, by virtue thereof he may give one vote to each of said six directors, or six votes for any one thereof, or a less number of votes for a less number of directors, and in this manner may distribute or cumulate his votes as he may see fit.\" Purdon's Laws of Penn., 1874, Corp.,\nss. 5, 22. By these statutes a stockholder is expressly given the right to multiply his single vote by the number of directors to be elected, or he is empowered to cumulate his votes in those cases where he is entitled to one vote for each of the directors to be elected; but by the New Hampshire statute an increase of votes is not given. It may be conceded that if a stockholder was entitled to more than one vote he could then cumulate these votes; but being entitled to one vote only, he cannot cumulate it. He may, however, avail himself of the benefit of the statute in another manner: being entitled to one vote for seven directors, he may cast this one vote for one director, or for two or more, as he prefers, by \"scratching\" as many candidates upon the majority ballot as are not acceptable to him, or he may cast his one vote for any other candidate.\n\nIf, however, by any ingenious argument, it is demonstrated that under the General Laws of New Hampshire a stockholder is entitled to more than one vote, as, for instance, one vote for each of seven directors, it remains to inquire into the nature and extent of the rights conferred by the statute of 1879. This act is neither restrictive nor directory, since it does not limit this right of cumulative voting to the minority qua minority, nor does it forbid the election of directors in any other than in the manner indicated. On the contrary, it is general and permissive, since it confers this right equally upon all stockholders, and allows them to exercise it or not, as they wish. The stockholders, therefore, may determine whether they will cast their votes cumulatively or not, since the manner of election, the forms of ballot, and all matters thereto pertaining, in the absence of any limitation in the charter, or of any statutory provision to the contrary, may be regulated by the stockholders. 2 Kent Com. 295; Com. v. Woelper, 3 S.  R. 29. For instance, assuming that the stockholders had, and always have had, the right to cast one vote for each of the seven directors to be chosen, yet it is clearly within the power of the stockholders to determine whether each director shall be voted for upon a separate ballot, or whether all the directors shall be voted for by one ballot at one time. Likewise, where the general power to vote by proxy is vested in corporations, the members may decide whether or not voting by proxy shall be exercised. Upon the same principle the stockholders can regulate the manner of voting cumulatively; and this they can do by an express resolve that no votes shall be cast or counted cumulatively, or by a resolve that the directors be balloted for separately and at different times; and the result of the first method would be that no stockholder could cast his votes or have them counted cumulatively while the result of the second method would be that all stockholders alike could cast their votes and have them counted cumulatively; and in the latter case the increased votes of the minority would be offset by a like increase in the vote of the majority. Therefore the respondent contends that the stockholders who voted for the relator were\nbound by the resolve that \"the corporation proceed to vote for seven directors upon one ballot at one time,\" because that resolve controlled and established the manner of election. If, however, the minority were not concluded by that resolve qua resolve, still they have estopped themselves from exercising the right claimed. This right, as we have seen, is not an absolute right, but a permissive right, &#8212; one which can be exercised or not, as a stockholder sees fit. Therefore, if the stockholders who voted for the relator had intended to exercise this right, they should have claimed it, and protested against the proposed resolve. But it does not appear from the facts, as found by the referee, that the minority objected in the least to this resolve; on the contrary, they may have voted for it, thereby inducing the majority to cast their ballots in accordance with the resolve, and causing them to lose the right to have their ballots counted cumulatively. By their actions the minority caused the majority to believe that they (the minority) would not exercise this right, consequently they were estopped from subsequently asserting it.\n\nIf, however, the minority are not bound by the resolve, nor estopped by their conduct, from asserting the right to have their votes counted cumulatively, still the respondent is entitled to exercise the duties of a director of the Concord Railroad by virtue of the election next preceding the last annual meeting. For, if the respondent was not elected at the last annual meeting, neither were the other six candidates who were balloted for at the same time upon the same ballot; for the court will take judicial notice that there is the same defect in the title of all the candidates declared elected. If the respondent was not elected, it must be because he did not receive a majority of the votes cast; and if he did not, this must equally be true of all the other candidates who were voted for upon the same ticket. This court, therefore, cannot find that the respondent was not elected, unless it finds that none of the acting directors were elected. Since, therefore, the stockholders have failed to elect seven directors, as directed by their charter, the court will order another election; but in no event will it simply unseat the respondent. It will not select any one of the acting directors and oust him in order to supply his place subsequently with another person, even though such person received a majority of the votes cast for that would be to permit the latter person to occupy the anomalous position of being the sole member of the board legally entitled to his seat. Neither will it oust all the acting directors, and allow the one person elected to perform all the duties of the office; but it will allow the directors who were elected at the last annual meeting to hold over until the new election takes place, for if, through accident, mistake, or misfortune, the annual election has elapsed, or the directors have not been chosen, it seems that the former officers would hold over until a new election was had. 2 Kent Com. 295.\n\nW. S. Ladd, for the defendant. 1. The charter of the Concord Railroad Corporation provides for the election of directors in the following terms, &#8212; \"at which meeting seven directors shall be chosen by ballot, each proprietor being entitled to as many votes as he holds shares, provided they do not exceed one tenth part of the whole number.\" Private Acts of 1835, c. 1, s. 10. That this grant constitutes a contract between the state on the one hand and the corporators on the other, has been too long and too well settled to be now brought into discussion. 2 Kent Com. 306; Cooley Const. Lim. 279; Angel  Ames Corp., s. 767; Sedgwick Stat. and Const. Law. 581, where the cases are collected. A change whereby it is provided that each proprietor shall be entitled to more votes than he holds shares, thus putting it in the power of the holder of a minority of the shares to choose one or more directors against the wish of the holders of a majority of the shares, would manifestly be a change in the intrinsic nature of the artificial person brought into existence by the act of incorporation, a change in the organic law of its being, and so a destruction of the vested rights of those who have embarked their money in the enterprise: for it was clearly the right of the purchasers of stock that the mode of providing for the management of the affairs of the corporation should not be changed without their consent. This was one of the considerations upon which their money was paid; and the right is quite as important, and rests quite as fully upon contract, as does the right of persons entering a trading partnership, and making contribution to its capital stock, that the direction of the affairs of the firm shall not be changed from that specified in the articles of partnership without their consent.\n\nIn Hays v. The Commonwealth, 82 Penn. St. 518, it was held that the people of the state, by an amendment of their constitution, could not destroy exactly the same kind of a right, and secured to the stockholders by a provision in the charter identical in substance with the one above quoted from the charter of the Concord Railroad. Gordon, J., in the above case, says, &#8212; \"If, however, we annul this provision of the charter, and substitute the constitutional provision above referred to, this shareholder will have ten votes for any one of the ten candidates for the office of manager whom he may choose to select, or five for each of any two he may so choose. Thus those holding a minority of the shares of the stock of this corporation would be enabled to do what under the charter is impossible, to wit, to elect, in spite of the majority, one or more of the managing officers. Now whilst it cannot be said that this would not be an alteration in the terms of this chapter, it is nevertheless urged that it is a mere regulation of the right of suffrage in corporations, but affects the vested rights of no one. But if it be not a vested right in those who own the major part of the stock of the corporation to elect, if they see proper, every member of the board of directors, then I would like to know what a vested right\nmeans. This was a part of the contract under which they entered into the company, and for which they paid their money. The compact was that they should have the power to elect those who should have the management and control of the funds which they advanced in this enterprise. . . . If the charter method of voting be a material part of the organic law of the company, it follows that the constitutional convention, even if it so intended, could not alter that method. . . . As there is in this case no allegation of a breach of any condition under which the Pittsburgh  C. S. R. R. Co. accepted its charter, or' that the charter is in any particular obnoxious to the welfare of the citizens of this commonwealth, it cannot be successfully urged that it may be revised or abrogated by any state authority whatever.\"\n\nIt may, perhaps, be contended that the act of 1879 can be upheld on the ground that it is an amendment of the charter of the Concord Railroad, and that the right to amend was reserved to the state in the act making the grant. Private Acts 1835, c. 1, s. 18. The first answer to this proposition is, that the act in question is not in terms, and does not purport to be, an amendment of that charter. That the legislature did not intend it as an amendment is very strongly shown by the fact that no notice was given that an amendment would be applied for. It is contrary to the spirit of our institutions, contrary to all the analogies furnished by the practice of courts and legislative assemblies of every description and contrary to justice and fair play, that questions affecting, perhaps destroying, important and valuable private rights should be mooted and settled behind the backs of those who are to be affected by the result, and without giving them an opportunity to appear and show cause why the proposed action should not be had. This one fact alone, therefore, furnishes very strong evidence that the legislature did not intend this act as an amendment of the charter. The act ought not to be given the interpretation and effect of a change of the charter in this particular, if it is capable of any other; because, although the right to amend is reserved in the charter, its exercise amounts to what would otherwise be the destruction of a vested right of property. Surely the fact that this vested property-right of the stockholder lies, as it were, at the mercy of the legislature, can have no other effect than to make the legislature exceedingly cautious that it is not destroyed or violated except upon very good cause shown; and when, as in this case, there is no proof or suggestion of any wrong or abuse on the part of the Concord Railroad or any of its stockholders, the strong presumption is that there was not an intention on the part of the legislature to destroy it. Such an intention will only be found upon the strongest evidence, and when the terms used admit of no other interpretation.\n\n\"By the theory of the British constitution, parliament is omnipotent; and hence an act of that body would undoubtedly be,\neffectual to the dissolution of a corporation. It is to the honor of the British nation, however, that this power, restrained by public opinion, rests merely in theory; and except in the instances of the suppression of the Order of Templars in the time of Edward the Second, and of the religious houses in the time of Henry the Eighth, we know of no occasion on which parliament have thought proper to dissolve, or confirm the arbitrary dissolution of, corporate bodies. When, in 1783, a bill was introduced for the purpose of remodelling the charter of the East India Company, it was opposed by Mr. Pitt and Lord Thurlow, not only as a dangerous violation of the charter of the company, but as a total subversion of the law and constitution of the country. In the nervous language of the latter, it was `an atrocious violation of private property, which cut every Englishman to the bone.'\" Angel  Ames Corp., s. 767. The relation in which our legislature stands to a corporation in the charter of which the right to amend is reserved, is the same as that of the parliament of Great Britain to a corporation in which no such right is reserved; for the right always remains in the parliament without reservation by reason of the omnipotence of that body. Chancellor Kent says \"it is easy to perceive that if such a clause [a reservation of the right to amend], inserted as a formula in every charter and grant of the government, be sufficient to give the state an unlimited control, at its pleasure, of all its grants, however valuable the consideration upon which they may be founded, the great and salutary provision in the constitution of the United States, so far as concerns all grants from state governments, will become of no moment. These legislative reservations of a right of repeal ought to be under the guidance of extreme moderation and discretion.\" 2 Kent Com. 306.\n\nSuch considerations will induce the court to look carefully at this act to see if its language does not fairly admit of an interpretation which shall not have the effect of an amendment to the charter, whereby its constitution will be so radically changed, and the private rights of its stockholders so unreasonably disregarded and destroyed. We submit that it is well capable of such interpretation, &#8212; in fact, that any other would do violence to the manifest intention of the legislature. It purports to be a general law. Hence it is to be presumed that the intention of the legislature was that it should be prospective, and not retroactive, in its application and effect. \"The general rule is, that no statute, however positive in its terms, is to be construed as designed to interfere with existing contracts, rights of suits, and especially vested rights, unless the intention that it shall so operate is expressly declared; and courts will apply new statutes only to future cases, unless there is something in the very nature of the case, or in the language of the new provision, which shows that they were intended to have a retroactive operation.\" Note to Potter's Dwarris 162, and cases cited. \"We have before said that the legislature of a\nstate possesses all legislative power not prohibited by the constitution. But, by all known rules of interpretation, the general rule as to their power by its very nature is prospective. They are invested with the power to enact laws. Laws are rules of civil conduct, prescribed for and attaching themselves to the future actions of men. They must of necessity and from their nature be prospective; otherwise they cannot be rules of civil conduct. Laws cannot attach themselves to conduct antecedent to the creation of the rules themselves,\" etc. Potter's Dwarris, 164, et seq.; Morrison Dig. 160, 161, 162.\n\nIf this act is what it purports to be, namely, a general law, we are forbidden to give it such interpretation as will amount to an amendment, not only of the charter of the Concord Railroad, but of every other private corporation in the state, by art. 23 of the bill of rights, as well as by the fundamental doctrine of the common law above set forth, for that would be giving it a retroactive operation whereby vested rights would be taken away. But if, on the other hand, we undertake to say it is a private act, operating as an amendment of all those charters, and therefore within the power of the legislature, reserved when they were granted, we reach the conclusion that the legislature intended by one stroke to do in effect and to all practical intents the very mischief which the constitution and the rule of law were intended to protect the people against. What have all these corporations and all their stockholders done that they should be singled out for legislative vengeance in this way? Nothing at all, so far as now appears. How, then, can it be supposed that the legislature intended to visit them with an enactment so highly penal, especially when they put their enactment in the usual form of acts which are to take effect and be operative after instead of before their passage? We submit that this act cannot be regarded as an amendment to the charter of the Concord Railroad within the provision of s. 18, and that therefore, as a general law of the state, it can be given no operation except in the case of corporations incorporated after its passage.\n\nII. The act of 1879, under which the relator claims, was never enacted in the only way provided by the constitution for the enactment of statutes, and was therefore never the law of the state. \"The supreme legislative power within this state shall be vested in the senate and house of representatives, each of which shall have a negative upon the other.\" Const N.H., Part II, art. 2. This point has been argued in the brief already furnished by Mr. Wilson, and the cases pretty generally cited. It is only proposed to refer to one or two other cases, and to present as our argument of the question a few brief quotations from opinions of courts where the matter appears to have been most thoroughly and carefully considered. In The Borough of West Philadelphia, 5 W.  S. 281, Gibson, C. J., says, &#8212; \"Under a well balanced constitution the legislature can no more delegate its proper function than can\nthe judiciary. It is on the preservation of the lines which separate the cardinal branches of the government that the liberties of the citizen depend; for a consolidated sovereignty, in whatever form, is despotism, in so far as it subjects the governed not to prescribed rules of action, to which he may safely square his conduct beforehand, but to the unsettled will of the ruling power, which cannot be foreseen, and a government becomes consolidated in proportion as its legislative branch abandons its own functions, or usurps those which have been vested elsewhere. In the very constitution of things, the whole people of the state cannot assemble together to exercise the sovereign power in person; and it is not to be regretted that they cannot, for their rule, being untrammelled by anything but their own will, would be as arbitrary and fitful in its exercise as any other uncontrolled domination. When they delegate it to an undivided agency, they slip their hold of it and in turn become its slaves.\"\n\nIn C. W.  Z. R. R. Co. v. Commissioners of Clinton County,  1 Ohio St. 77 , Ranney, J., delivering the opinion of the court, says, &#8212; \"That the general assembly cannot surrender any portion of the legislative authority with which it is invested, or authorize its exercise by any other person or body, is a proposition too clear for argument, and is denied by no one. The inability arises no less from the general principle applicable to every delegated power requiring knowledge, discretion, and rectitude in its exercise, than from the positive provisions of the constitution itself. The people in whom it resided have voluntarily relinquished its exercise, and have positively ordained that it shall be vested in the general assembly. It can only be reclaimed by them by an amendment or abolition of the constitution. To allow the general assembly to cast it back upon them would be to subvert the constitution and change its distribution of powers without their action or consent. The checks, balances, and safeguards of that instrument are intended no less for the protection and safety of the minority than the majority. Hence, while it continues in force, every citizen has a right to demand that his civil conduct shall only be regulated by the associated wisdom, intelligence, and integrity of the whole representation of the state.\"\n\nIn State v. Beneke,  9 Iowa 203 , Woodward, J., says, &#8212; \"On this subject we entertain no doubts. The general assembly cannot legally submit to the people the proposition whether an act shall become a law or not; and the people have no power in their primary and individual capacity to make laws. They do this by representatives. There is no doubt of the authority of the legislature to pass an act to take effect upon a contingency. But what is a contingency in this sense and connection? It is some event independent of the will of the law-making power, as exercised in making the law, or some event over which the legislature has no control. For instance, the embargo laws and their cessation were\nmade to depend on the action of foreign powers. The will of the law-maker is not a contingency in relation to himself. It may be such in relation to another and external power, but to call it so in relation to himself is an abuse of language. Now, if the people are to say whether or not an act shall become a law, they become, or are put in the place of, the law-maker. And here is the constitutional objection. Their will is not a contingency upon which certain things are or are not to be done under the law, but it becomes the determining power whether such shall be the law or not. This makes them the `legislative authority,' which by the constitution is vested in the senate and house of representatives and not in the people.\" Special attention is called to the whole of the opinion of Ruggles, C. J, in Barto v. Himrod,  8 N.Y. 483 . The consequences of sanctioning this method of legislation are not overdrawn by Willard, J., in the same case. He says, &#8212; \"If this mode of legislation is permitted and becomes general, it will soon bring to a close the whole system of representative government which has been so justly our pride. The legislature will become an irresponsible cabal, too timid to assume the responsibility of lawgivers, and with just wisdom enough to devise subtile schemes of imposture to mislead the people. All the checks against improvident legislation will be swept away; and the character of the constitution will be radically changed.\"\n\nBut one case which seems to us to be in point the other way has been found, &#8212; Smith v. Janesville,  26 Wis. 291 ; and that, being put wholly upon the authority of a previous \"local option\" case in the same state, furnishes no discussion of the principle involved that aids us much in the inquiry.\n\nIt is true there are some expressions in the opinion of Redfield, C. J., in State v. Parker,  26 Vt. 357 , which indicate that in 1854 he was inclined to the idea that a popular vote upon a general law submitted to the people by the legislature might be regarded as a contingency, upon the result of which the proposition so submitted might become a law. A short extract from the opinion shows, however, that the decision of the case was not put at all upon that ground. He says, &#8212; \"But the law of 1852 did not, even in form, depend upon the vote of the people for its coming in force. The statute in terms was made to come in force just when it did, &#8212; on the second Tuesday of March, 1853; and if there had been no meetings of the freemen called, or no vote had been taken, the statute would still have become a law just when it did. The only thing made contingent and conditional in the statute was, in one single event, that the operation of the law should be suspended until after the next session of the legislature. It may be said this difference is not much. I know that very well. But it is as much as that between a condition precedent and a condition subsequent; and this, in the case of an illegal condition, as it is claimed this was, is quite important. In the former case, the contract or act is rendered\nvoid; and in the latter the condition is only avoided, and the contract or act remains in force. And we do not see but, upon sound reasoning and good logic, the result must be the same in regard to statutes. We think it must be and should be. The condition or proviso was only for suspending the operation of the statute: and if the legislature had no right to annex any such condition, then the statute will not be affected by it. It might have been wholly disregarded by the people, and the effect must have been the same. The law would have come in force on the second Tuesday in March. And did the taking a vote (which was in the affirmative, to be sure, but which, if it had been in the negative, was, it is claimed, of no force, and should consequently be disregarded) make the legal state of the enactment any different? We think not. And thus the form of enacting this statute seems to steer quite clear of the main, argument upon which all the cases have gone, where similar statutes have been held invalid. And in regard to the statute of 1852, it cannot with any show of fairness be said the legislature did not enact the law, and fully pass upon all questions of constitutionality or expediency involved in the subject.\"\n\nThe distinction between this case and such cases as State v. Noyes, 30 N.H. 279 , seems to be broad and well defined. A single point of difference is all that we consider it necessary now to suggest. Towns under our New England system are intrusted with very many and very important governmental powers and functions, among which is the power to adopt and enforce such reasonable regulations as may be thought best calculated to promote the peace, good order, and welfare of their communities. A police regulation that may be very wholesome and valuable in one town, may, on account of some diversity in population, geographical situation, or other cause, be inapplicable and inexpedient in another. Hence the legislature have properly gone very far in allowing to these miniature commonwealths considerable latitude in adopting or rejecting laws for the preservation of order and the regulating of their police affairs. This is obviously a very different thing from submitting the question whether a given act shall become the general law of the state, to the decision of the whole people of the state. In case of the local option laws referred to, the question is submitted to the very body politic to be affected by them. This case would bear a much closer analogy to those if the law had been left to take effect upon such corporations, and such only, as adopted it.\n\nThe attempt here is to force upon the people the burden and responsibility of deciding in their primary capacity whether a proposed measure shall or shall not become a general law of the state. That is exactly the business and duty of the legislature as prescribed by the constitution, and so is exactly what the legislature cannot require the people to do for them. To call such an expression of opinion by the people, as to the policy and expediency of\nthe measure, by the name of a contingency, with respect to the taking effect of the proposition as law, does not make it such. It is simply a misuse of words. In fact, it is no such thing. In fact, it is the thing, and the only thing, which gives to the proposal the force and vitality of law. The vote of the people is expressly made the fiat of the law-maker. To call that fiat a \"contingency,\" whereupon the taking effect of the law depends, is just like saying, \"If a bill pending before the legislature passes both houses, and receives the approval of the governor, it will become law, otherwise not, which is saying, \"If a thing happens, it will happen; if it does not happen, it will not happen; whether it happens or not is a contingency upon which its happening depends\" &#8212; a kind of logic which does not make progress because it stands still.\n\nTowns and cities are organized entities created by the legislature, with such faculties, functions, and powers, both public and private, and charged with such duties, both political and economical, as in the judgment of the legislature the public good requires. If the public good requires the existence of this class of legal per sons, it surely requires that they should be endowed with all necessary and reasonable means and capabilities for self-preservation and protection, and with such faculties as are convenient and proper, under the general laws of the state, to promote their well-being. Acts creating municipal corporations, and endowing them with such functions as are above alluded to, constitute legislation in the proper and legal sense of that term. The exercise by them of the functions with which they are thus wisely endowed by their creator for the purposes suggested is not legislation in the proper and legal sense of that term, any more than the making of by-laws by a private corporation is legislation. It is only because many of the duties and powers of municipal corporations are of a public and political character, that their acts, under authority conferred by general law and by their charters, seem more like an exercise of general legislative power than do the acts of a manufacturing corporation, done under authority given by their charter and the general law of the state. Both derive their existence and powers from the same source. One has for its prime purpose the promotion of the general welfare, and is therefore clothed with the powers, etc., necessary and convenient for the attainment of that end. The other has for its prime purpose the carrying on of some lawful business whereby money may be made. The character of each is determined in the outset with regard to the office it is to perform in the economy of the state.\n\nThe vote of a town to accept and adopt the provisions of any local option law is no more legislative, in the proper legal acceptation of the term, than the signing by ten men of articles of association to form a voluntary corporation under the statute. In each case it is simply the expression of a wish to use and enjoy the benefits of a general law of the state.\n\nJ. Y. Mugridge, for the defendant. I. This is an information brought by the attorney-general upon the relation of a private citizen, and could not be filed without leave of the court. There is a distinction between cases where the proceedings are instituted by the attorney-general ex officio, and without a relator, and cases brought upon the relation of a private individual. In the former case, information is filed as of course, without leave of the court, but in the latter case can only be filed by leave of the court first had and obtained for that purpose, and the application is not. granted as of course, but rests in the sound discretion of the court. High Ex. Rem. 515; State v. Stewart,  32 Mo. 379 ; State v. Lawrence, 38 Mo. 535 ; State v. Buskirk,  43 Mo. 111 .\n\nII. A very important question presents itself as to what is the true, legal construction of that portion of the law which provides that \"in all elections for directors or managers of corporations, each member or stockholder may cast the whole number of his votes for one candidate, or may distribute them upon two or more candidates, as he may prefer.\" At an election in which a single officer or different officers of the same board by separate ballotings are chosen, the question suggested would arise in this way: In the ordinary manner of proceeding at stockholders' meetings to choose officers, each stockholder throws one ballot, on which is endorsed the number of shares for which he is entitled to vote; and it has been generally understood that a voter, although voting on several shares, could only represent them as a whole, and consequently could not so divide his vote as that one part should be thrown for one candidate and the balance for others. In such a case this act might have the effect to give the voter the right to divide his votes according to the number of shares voted by him, as he might elect. But in cases where one balloting takes place for different members of the same board, other considerations would arise. With reference to such cases, the provisions of the act in question are so vague and uncertain in their character as to place the matter in great doubt. The act only provides that each member or stockholder may cast \"the whole number of his votes\" for one candidate, or may distribute them, etc., but there is nothing in the law defining what is meant by \"his votes,\" or what those words comprehend. The provision of Gen. Laws, c. 148, s. 18, which is still in force notwithstanding the act in question, is that each stockholder in any corporation \"may give one vote at any meeting thereof for every share he owns therein.\" If, under the law in question, a stockholder is to be allowed to throw a number of votes for one or more directors, equal to his number of shares multiplied by the whole number of directors to be elected, the consequence is, in case of a board of seven directors, like that of the Concord Railroad, that the stockholder is permitted to cast seven times as many votes as he is allowed to under the general provisions of the law above cited, which would be not only regulating the cast of \"his\nvotes,\" as the act in its terms indicates, but would be also a multiplication of the number of the votes. The general laws referred to, by express limitation, restrict a stockholder in his vote to the number of shares owned by him; and his right of voting, \"the whole number of his votes,\" is not enlarged, though he may vote for several candidates on the same ballot, but the votes will be regarded as being thrown for each separately, as if they were cast on separate ballotings, and the number is confined to the number of shares owned by him.\n\nIn this particular the act in question is clearly defective, and inadequate to accomplish the object suggested. In this respect it differs from the constitutional provisions in the state of Illinois with reference to the same matter. Those provisions are, that \"in all elections of representatives as aforesaid, each qualified voter may cast as many votes for one candidate as there are representatives to be elected, or may distribute the same or equal parts thereof among the candidates, as he shall see fit.\" Rev. Sts., Ills., 1874, 62, ss 7, 8; &#8212; see, also, p. 217, s. 54, as to minority plan for aldermen. Here is found a clear and express provision for an increase of votes which the object suggested necessarily demands.\n\nThe act in question is similar in its terms to the provisions of the revised constitution of Pennsylvania on the same subject. In the decision of Hays v. Commonwealth, 82 Penn. St. 518, it is assumed for the purposes of the discussion that the legal effect of that provision was the same as above suggested as being the object of the law. This was not the point, however, settled in that case. From what is said by the court, it would appear doubtful whether the consequence of the provision was designed to be, or was in law, what it was there assumed to be, because the provision, as originally prepared, as in the constitution of Illinois, included additional words to indicate the effect assumed, if intended, but those words were subsequently rejected. An examination of the case of Com. v. Lintsman (in the same state), 23 Pitts. L. J. 122, will show that the legal effect of the provision referred to does not extend so far as assumed in Hays v. Commonwealth, but only to allow a stockholder owning several shares to divide his votes among different candidates, but not to increase the number of his votes. The doctrine of that case is, that under the cumulative method of voting a stockholder may cast for one or more candidates as many votes as he owns shares, and is an authority in point to support the views expressed as to the effect of the act in this state, in similar terms, to be merely to regulate the method of casting what votes a stockholder may have under our general laws, and not to increase the number of votes in any way.\n\nWm. L. Foster, for the defendant. I. Since the decision of the Dartmouth College case, in 1819, it has ceased to be a point for discussion that the charter of a corporation is a contract, within the\nclause of the federal constitution, which declares that no state shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts. Such laws, said Mr. Madison, are \"contrary to the first principles of the social compact, and to every principle of sound legislation. . . . Very properly, therefore, have the convention added this constitutional bulwark in favor of personal security and private rights.\" The Federalist, No. XLIV. \"It is not competent even for the royal prerogative, without the consent of the corporation, to alter or abridge a corporate charter. It can be revoked only in the case of a forfeiture for negligence or abuse of the franchise judicially ascertained.\". P. W.  B. R. R. Co. v. Bowers, 4 Hous. (Del). 506, 529-534. The constitution makes no distinction between executory and executed contracts, the latter, as much as the former, being within its protection. Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 133. The contracts intended by the constitution are all those over which the state can have authority, and which, but for this provision, might be reached by state law. The contracts of the state itself are therefore intended, as much as those of individuals; and a state is thus precluded from impairing its own grants, unless the right to do so is reserved in the charter itself. 3 Pars. Con. 527; Cooley Const. Lim. 279; Potter's Dwarris 477. It may seem superfluous to cite authorities in support of a principle universally recognized; but the reasoning and arguments of the following, among the hundreds of cases to the same effect, are worthy of attention: Fletcher v. Peck, supra; Huidekoper v. Douglass, 3 Cranch 1; New Jersey v. Wilson, 7 Cranch 164; Sturges v. Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 199; Wilkinson v. Leland, 2 Pet. 627; Vanhorne v. Dorrance, 2 Dall. 304; Rice v. R. R. Co., 1 Black 358; Bank v. Skelly, 1 Black 436; Commercial Bank v. The State,  12 Miss. 439 ; Gordon v. Appeal Tax Court, 3 How. 133; Woodruff v. Trapnall, 10 How. 190; State Bank of Ohio v. Knoop, 16 How. 369; Dodge v. Woolsey, 18 How. 331; The Binghamton Bridge Case, 3 Wall. 51; Furman v. Nichol, 8. Wall. 44; Home of the Friendless v. Rouse, 8 Wall. 430; Washington University v. Rouse, 8 Wall. 439; Murray v. Charleston,  96 U.S. 482 ; Farrington v. Tennessee, 95 U.S. 679 ; New Jersey v. Yard,  95 U.S. 104 ,  114 ,  116 ; Beer Co. v. Massachusetts,  97 U.S. 25 ; Keith v. Clark,  97 U.S. 454 ; Sala v. New Orleans, 2 Woods 188. The charter of a railroad is within the constitutional prohibition; and any legislative act having the effect to abridge or restrict any power or privilege vested by the charter, which is material to the beneficial exercise of the franchise granted, and which must be supposed to have entered into the consideration which induced the corporation to accept the charter and to assume the duties imposed by it, is such an alteration as the constitutional provision forbids; and any act so operating is invalid. P. W.  B. R. R. Co. v. Bowers, supra; Bailey v. P. W.  B. R. R. Co., 4 Harr. (Del.) 389.\n\nThe contract between the state and the Concord Railroad, which\nprovided that directors should be chosen by ballot, \"each proprietor being entitled to as many votes as he holds shares,\" c., was a contract expressing, granting, and confirming the democratic doctrine and the fundamental right of the majority to govern, &#8212; a right not peculiar to popular elections, but pertaining as well to all matters of control in corporations and other associations. The grantees of the Concord Railroad never understood they were accepting a charter which could afterwards be so perverted from its original design as to subject the will and power of the majority to the dictation and control of a minority, or permit an interference with the powers conferred upon directors, selected by the confidence and preference of the stockholders, by a factious individual, seeking the advancement of his personal schemes and ambition, without the confidence, and in disregard of the preference and will, of the majority. They never understood that, without their consent, they could be placed in such a position with regard to the choice of directors, to whom are entrusted the control of all their prudential affairs, as that, while one person might be enabled by the multiplication of his votes to defeat the will of the majority, another person might not by the multiplication of his votes defeat the scheme of an obnoxious minority. That such would be the practical effect of such a construction of the act of 1879, c. 54, as is given it by the relator, is manifest. For example: Suppose the whole number of votes cast for directors is 13,999. P, desiring to become a director, induces A, having 2,000 shares of stock, to multiply his vote by 7, and cast it for P, and so elect P. But B, having 2,000 shares of stock, and desiring to defeat the election of P, cannot, by any method of cumulation or distribution known to the law, cast 14,000 votes against P. Provisions so unequal, partial, and unjust, involving such a restriction of powers and privileges material to the beneficial exercise of the franchise, were never bargained for by the grantees when they accepted the charter of the Concord Railroad.\n\nII. The right to amend the charter was reserved in the original grant; but the legislature never assumed nor intended to exercise the power of amendment. If they undertook to effect the same practical result by the legislation of 1879, their purpose was ineffectual because the method employed was unconstitutional. If their intention had been to exercise the power of amendment reserved by s. 18 of the charter of the Concord Railroad, they would have expressed that intention by the use of unequivocal terms; not, however (it is to be presumed), without having first given the corporation an opportunity to be heard in defence of such an invasion of their privileges, &#8212; not without proof of an \"abuse of their franchise judicially ascertained.\" I suppose an amendment, in a particular so substantial and vital to the interests of the stockholders, is no more to be inferred by implication from the terms of a general law in which no express allusion is made\nto the private act, than the repeal of a special act is inferred from a general law having remote reference to the subject of the special law. And though a statute may be repealed by necessary implication and without express words, the leaning of the courts is against such a doctrine. Chegaray v. Jenkins, 3 Sandf. 409; Potter's Dwarris 113, n. 9; Goodrich v. Milwaukee;  24 Wis. 422 ; Horton v. Mobile School Com'rs.  43 Ala. 598 ; Gill v. The State,  30 Tex. 614 ; Kerlinger v. Barnes,  14 Minn. 526 ;. The act of 1879, therefore, is not an amendment of the charter of the Concord Railroad.\n\nIII. The act of 1879, being retrospective in its character, is in violation of the bill of rights, art. 23, and of the fundamental principles of the common law. This point is involved in the preceding.\n\nIV. The act of 1879 is not a constitutional law, because it was not enacted \"by the supreme legislative power.\" Const. of N.H., Part II, art 2. This power, originally possessed by the people was committed by them to their representative body, the state legislature, in unlimited terms. The legislature holds and retains the power by constitutional grant, and it cannot recommit or delegate it to the people, or to any other body or authority whatever. Cooley Const. Lim. 116-125.\n\nV. The relator is estopped from claiming his own election, because of the method of voting adopted by the stockholders, without the protest or dissent of the relator or any person representing the minority. Thus, it has been held that if a member of a board of directors of a corporation be present at the adoption of a resolution, and be aware of what is being done, and makes no opposition to its adoption, he must be presumed to have assented to it Mowry v. Ind.  Cin. R. R. Co., 4 Biss. 78. The report of the referee shows that the relator was present in person and by counsel, and knew \"what was being done,\" and made no remarks \"in the nature of suggestion, protest, or otherwise.\"\n\nBingham  Mitchell, for the plaintiff. I. The defendant asks the court to declare unconstitutional the act to provide for minority representation in corporations, passed in 1879. To be entitled to have this request granted, the defendant must show, and the court must be able to see, that this act is clearly, palpably, and beyond a reasonable doubt, repugnant to the constitution. It is presumptively constitutional, and cannot be pronounced otherwise except upon a very clear case. \"When called upon to pronounce an act of legislation, passed with all the forms and solemnities requisite to give it the force of law, invalid and void in consequence of its conflicting with some constitutional provision, courts will approach the question with great caution, examine it in every possible aspect, and ponder upon it as long as deliberation and patient attention can throw any new light upon the subject, and will\nnever declare a statute void unless the nullity and invalidity of the act are placed, in their judgment, beyond all reasonable doubt.\" Sargent, J., in Rich v. Flanders,  39 N.H. 312 . \"It is never to be forgotten that the presumption is always in favor of the validity of the law, and it is only when manifest assumption of authority and clear incompatibility between the constitution and the law appear, that the judicial power can refuse to execute it. Such interference can never be permitted in a doubtful case.\" Cin. W.  Z. R. R. v. Com'rs,  1 Ohio St., 77 . The rule is even more pointedly stated in Groesch v. The State,  42 Ind. 558 . \"We can declare an act of the legislature void only when it violates the constitution clearly, palpably, plainly, and in such a manner as to leave no doubt or hesitation on our minds.\"\n\nThere is in this connection, also, another consideration to be kept in view, and that is this: The constitution of New Hampshire is not so much a grant of specific power, as it is a limitation of the exercise of general powers. Concord Railroad v. Greely,  17 N.H. 47 . Consequently, no act of the legislature should be regarded as prohibited which is not so either in express terms, or by fair and reasonable implication. Lowrey v. Gridley, 30 Conn. 450 .\n\nGoverned by these rules, we are to examine the defendant's constitutional objections to this law, and the authorities relied upon to support them. The defendant insists that taking \"the sense of the voters of this state\" upon the first section of the act is legislation, and that consequently it is not an act of the legislature, but an act passed by the people. We maintain that it is an act of the legislature full and complete; and its going into effect on a designated day, or not at all, depended upon a contingency provided by the legislature in the exercise of its constitutional prerogative. The people were agents to determine a contingency, and not legislators. The legislature enacted the law; the people were instrumental in creating a contingency, on the occurrence of which the law took effect. The result of the vote applied to the going into effect of the law, and not to its passage or enactment: that had already been accomplished by the legislature.\n\nThe legislature preceded the act with the declaration that it be \"enacted by the senate and house of representatives in general court convened,\" and not by the people. Its effect and operation depend upon a condition or contingency. Had there been no time fixed, and no mode prescribed to determine the time, the act would go into effect September 15, 1879. Is not this delegating legislative functions to the agency which produces the revolutions of the globe? If it was to go into effect upon each individual corporation's action, as suggested by the defendant's counsel, would this not be delegating to corporations the powers of legislation? If it was to go into effect, as suggested by another of the defendant's counsel, when the Lake Shore charter was granted, or a general railroad law was passed, would not this savor a little of one legislature\ndelegating its powers to another? If it was to become a law when a foreign power did a certain prescribed act, would it not be delegating legislative powers to such foreign power? The defendant will concur fully with us that either or all of these agencies may constitutionally be employed by the legislature to determine a contingency upon the happening of which a law taxes effect. But the defendant disagrees with us when we insist that the people may be constitutionally entrusted with such agency. The defendant's position, we submit, is founded in the confusion and confounding of the plain distinction between the exercise of legislative power in framing and enacting laws, and the exercise of an altogether different and foreign, but subordinate, power in producing the event or result upon which such enactment is to take effect as a law.\n\nTo support his position, that this reference to the people is legislation and not a contingency, the defendant, in his first brief, cites forty-four different decided cases, excluding those of Massachusetts and New Hampshire. A large number of them are direct and conclusive authorities against the defendant's position. Some of them are overruled in direct and explicit terms by some of the others. Many of them deny the authority of some of the others. All of them that are law today in the states deciding them are either plainly distinguishable from this case, or are in direct conflict with the well settled law of New Hampshire as recognized and settled in State v. Noyes,  30 N.H. 279 . In that case, which was decided in July, 1865, the constitutionality of a law, which was to be in force only \"in such towns as shall at some legal meeting adopt the same,\" was involved. The respondent insisted, as the defendant here does, that the law was \"unconstitutional from the manner of its enactment. . . . The general court has no authority to delegate the power to enact laws to any men or body of men.\" And in support of this position the respondent's counsel cited one of the cases relied upon by the defendant here, viz. Rice v. Foster, 4 Harr. 479, which is a Delaware case decided in 1848. But the court held adversely to the position of the respondents, and in the opinion delivered by Judge Bell. said, &#8212; \"The case does not call for the discussion of the question of the constitutionality of submitting general laws to the people, and making their enactment dependent upon the popular vote. Many laws have been so presented to the people, and acted upon by them; and it is not at once apparent that there can be any sound objection to the enactment of laws to take effect upon the occurrence of future events, such as the legislature may prescribe. Laws framed to take effect upon conditions dependent upon the pleasure of parties to be affected by them are common everywhere.\"\n\nLet us now review the decided cases cited by Mr. Wilson. Pennsylvania: &#8212; Parker v. Com., 6 Penn. St. 507; Com. v. Quarter Sessions, 8 Penn. St. 391; Com. v. Painter, 10 Penn. St. 214; Locke's\nAppeal, 72 Penn. St. 491. The first case involved the constitutionality of a local option liquor license law. This was decided in 1847, and is the first case to be found, so far as we can find, which raises the question of the constitutionality of a law the operation of which is made dependent upon a popular vote of the people affected by it. The court held it unconstitutional. This is in direct conflict with the law as settled in State v. Noyes, supra. The second and third cases above cited practically and in effect overrule this case of Parker v. Commonwealth. The second was decided in March, 1848; and in that it was distinctly held that the legislature might repeal a law through the secondary means of a popular vote. In this case a new township had been erected from a part of another township, and the legislature submitted to the people of the old and new townships to determine by ballot whether the new township should be continued or annulled. The majority was to determine it. The law was held constitutional. In the third case, a law removing the seat of justice for Delaware county, if the majority favored it, was held constitutional. So it will be seen that they practically overrule the first case. This case of Parker v. Commonwealth is, as is said by Johnson, J., in Johnson v. Rich, 9 Barb. 680, decided December, 1851, the case which \"has been the great source of mischief and confusion of ideas upon subjects of this character.\" Its authority was denied by Johnson, J., who further said of it, &#8212; \"I have examined that case with great care and I am constrained to say, with all due respect, that, in my judgment, it cannot stand the test of time and scrutiny upon the reasons assigned by the learned judge who delivered the opinion. of the majority of the court.\"\n\nThe correctness of Judge Johnson's prophecy in respect to this case is clearly demonstrated by the fact that it was not followed by our own court in 1855, and has been repeatedly denied since by the courts of other states; and it was finally overruled by the court in which it originated, in Locke's Appeal, supra, decided 1873. The question involved in this case was the constitutionality of a license law, the operation of which depended upon the vote of the people of the localities desiring its operation. Judge Agnew in the court's opinion, said, &#8212; \"What did the legislature in this section submit to the people, and what did they not submit? This is quite as clear as any other part of the act. Each elector is to vote a ticket for license or against license. He is allowed by the law to say, `I am for the issuing of licenses,' or, `I am against the issuing of licenses,' and thus to express his judgment or opinion. But this is all he was permitted by the law to do. He declared no consequences, and prescribed no rule resulting from his opinion. Nor does the majority of votes declare a consequence. The return of a majority is but a mere numerical preponderance of votes, and expresses only the opinion of the greater number of electors upon the expediency or inexpediency of license in this\nward. When this is certified by the return, the legislature, not the voters, declare it shall (or it shall not) be lawful for any license to issue for the sale of spirituous liquor. Thus it is perfectly manifest this law was not made, pronounced, or ratified by the people; and the majority vote is but the ascertainment of the public sentiment, the expression of the general opinion, which, as a fact, the legislature have made the contingency on which the law shall operate. . . . Indeed, it was not delegated to the people to decide anything. They simply declared their views or wishes; and when they did so, it was the fiat of the law, not their vote, which commanded licenses to issue or not to issue. . . . It is urged that Parker v. Commonwealth, supra, decided the question before us. That case was overruled soon after it was decided, not in express terms, it is true, but its foundation was undermined when it was held that laws could constitutionally be made dependent on a popular vote for their operation. The reasoning in Parker v. Commonwealth is fallacious, in assuming the fact that there was a delegation of legislative power. . . . The law did not spring from the vote, but the vote sprang from the law, and the law alone declared the consequences to flow from the vote. The assumption that the act is not a law till enacted by the people is the foundation of the argument, and with its fall the superstructure vanishes. The character of this law is precisely that of hundreds of others which the legislative will makes dependent on some future act or fact for its operation. To assert that a law is less than a law because it is made to depend on a future event or act, is to rob the legislature of the power to act wisely for the public welfare whenever a law is passed relating to a state of affairs not yet developed, or to things future and impossible to fully know. Such an assertion attacks even the moral government of the creator. . . . Then the true distinction, I conceive, is this: The legislature cannot delegate its power to make a law; but it can make a law to delegate a power to determine some fact or state of things upon which the law makes, or intends to make, its own action depend. To deny this would be to stop the wheels of government. There are many things upon which wise and useful legislation must depend which cannot be known to the lawmaking power, and must, therefore, be a subject of inquiry and determination outside of the halls of legislation. . . .\" In speaking further of Parker v. Commonwealth, Agnew, J., said, &#8212; \"Nor have I thought it necessary to refer to the decisions in other states, for the plain reason, also, that our own decisions since Parker v. Commonwealth rule the case; while that case was the forerunner of the decisions of all the other states (except Delaware), and with its fall they have lost their chief prop and support.\" So it will be seen that Pennsylvania, the mother of the heresy upon which the defendant founds his constitutional objection to this act, has in the most solemn and emphatic manner\nthrown it overboard, and comes back where Johnson, J., prophesied she would come, and plants herself on the side of New Hampshire, and in support of our position.\n\nRice v. Foster, supra, is the only case cited from Delaware, and it was decided in 1848. This involved the constitutionality of a local option liquor law. The court held the law unconstitutional, because its operation depended upon the popular vote of the people of the different counties. It is in direct conflict with State v. Noyes, supra, and is cited in that case by the respondent. Its authority was denied by the court, or, at least, a contrary doctrine was settled by the court in that case. The doctrine of this case having been repudiated in 1855, it is now too late to ask the court to overrule its own decision for the sake of recognizing this as an authority.\n\nThe defendant cites from New York, Thorne v. Cramer, 15 Barb. 112; Bradley v. Baxter, 15 Barb. 122; Barto v. Himrod,  8 N.Y. 483 ; Bank v. Brown,  26 N.Y. 467 ; Corning v. Greene, 23 Barb. 33; Gloversville v. Howell,  70 N.Y. 287 . We cite Johnson v. Rich, supra; Clarke v. Rochester, 24 Barb. 476. In Thorne v. Cramer, Bradley v. Baxter, Barto v. Himrod, and Johnson v. Rich, are involved the constitutionality of the New York school law, which contained the following provision: The \"electors shall determine by ballot, at the annual election to be held in November next, whether this act shall or shall not become a law.\" Thorne v. Cramer was decided in October, 1851, by the New York supreme court, and the law held unconstitutional, upon the authority of Parker v. Commonwealth, supra, which we have before commented upon, and shown to have been overruled even at the time it was here cited as an authority. Bradley v. Baxter, supra, decided in April, 1853, held the law unconstitutional, upon the authority of Parker v. Commonwealth and Rice v. Foster, supra, one of which was then overruled in its own state, and both of which are in conflict with the doctrine of our own case of State v. Noyes. The case of Barto v. Himrod was decided in the same way in 1853, following the doctrine of the supreme court cases of Thorne v. Cramer and Bradley v. Baxter. In 1851, the supreme court of New York held this law constitutional in Johnson v. Rich, supra. In delivering the court's opinion, Johnson, J., said, &#8212; \"The substance and plain import of the two sections, taken together, are, that the act shall become a law on a day certain, upon the condition that a majority of all the votes cast in the state upon the subject shall be, when canvassed, found in its favor, and that otherwise it shall be null and void. The proviso is, not that it shall not be enacted by the legislature, but that it shall not become operative as a law after its enactment except upon the condition or proviso being fulfilled. In short, they enacted that the enactment should not become a law of the land except upon the happening of a certain event, which was a majority of the votes being cast in its favor. But the position is\nassumed and urged with great strenuousness, that because the act in question could not become a law unless a majority of the electors should vote in its favor, it follows, as a necessary consequence, that the electors passed the act at a general election, and that the act undertook to clothe them with legislative power. But this consequence by no means follows. The same might be said of every act which is passed to take effect upon the happening of some event, certain or uncertain. It is no law unless the event happens; and yet it has never been supposed that any legislative power was conferred upon the agency by which the event was brought about. . . . The whole difficulty seems to me to have arisen from confounding the distinction between the exercise of legislative power in framing and enacting laws, or a statute which is to become a law, and the exercise of another altogether different and foreign but subordinate power, in producing the event or result upon which such enactment is to take effect as a law. The distinction seems to me too broad and obvious to be overlooked by any mind, the avenues to which are not too firmly barred by foregone conclusions, and which is unbiased by a fixed habit of constitutional scruples.\" The doctrine of this case was recognized in Clarke v. Rochester, supra, decided in 1857. Corning v. Greene, supra, cited by the defendant, does not raise this question. The question in Bank v. Brown was upon the constitutionality of an act which authorized the electors of an incorporated village to determine what sections of the general incorporation act should apply to their village. The court held the law constitutional. So far, then, as this is an authority at all, it is one for the plaintiff. In Gloversville v. Howell, a local option liquor law was held constitutional. This, also, is an authority for the plaintiff instead of for the defendant. The New York courts disagree; and there is not only a conflict of opinion, but a conflict of decision. The doctrine of those courts adverse to our position has been undermined and practically overruled by the later decisions of the same courts.\n\nWe will next call attention to Vermont. State v. Parker,  26 Vt. 357 , decided March, 1854. This involved the constitutionality of the Vermont liquor law, passed November, 1852. It provided that on the second Tuesday of February, 1853, a meeting of the freemen be holden to vote \"upon their judgment and choice in regard to this act,\" and \"if a majority of the ballots cast shall be `No,' then this act shall take effect in December, 1853.\" The vote was \"Yes,\" and the act went into effect in March, 1853. The act was held constitutional by the court. Redfield, C. J., in the court's opinion, said, &#8212; \"In this state the constitution vests the legislative power in a general assembly, consisting of a house of representatives and the senate; and if the mode of proceeding under consideration is equivalent to giving legislative power to the people at large, it is, no doubt, in conflict with the constitution. But it is not very obvious to us why this should be so regarded, unless it is\ndone as a matter of argument, and to justify a foregone conclusion, which is not one of the legitimate elements of a judicial determination. . . . And it is admitted on all hands that the legislature may enact laws the operation or suspension of which shall be made to depend upon a contingency. This could not be questioned with any show of reason or sound logic. It has been practised in all free states for hundreds of years, and no one has been lynx-eyed enough to discover, or certainly bold enough to declare, that such legislation was, on that account, void or irregular. And it is, in my judgment, a singular fact, that this remarkable discovery should first be made in the free representative democracies of America; and in regard to taking the sense of these same people upon the expediency of legislation, where the legislators are confessedly the mere agents and instruments of the people, to express their sovereign and superior will, to save the necessity of assembling the people in mass; and when, from the very nature of the case, the representative is in honor and good faith bound to conform his action to the will and desire of his constituents. . . . Congress passes laws almost every session, whose operation is made contingent upon the revenue laws of foreign states, or their navigation laws or regulations, and upon a hundred other uncertainties more or less affected by the will or agency of voluntary beings or communities . . .; and of the perfect regularity and constitutionality of such enactments, no question was ever made. . . . If the operation of a law may be fairly made to depend upon a future contingency, then, in my apprehension, it makes no essential difference what is the nature of the contingency, so it be an equal and fair one, a moral and legal one, not opposed to sound policy, and so far connected with the object and purpose of the statute as not to be a mere idle and arbitrary one. . . . After a full examination of the arguments be which it is attempted to be maintained that statutes made dependent upon such contingencies are not valid laws, and a good deal of study and reflection, I must declare that I am fully convinced, although at first, without munch examination, somewhat inclined to the same opinion, that the opinion is the result of false analogies, and so founded upon a latent fallacy. It seems to me that the distinction attempted between the contingency of a popular vote and other future uncertainties is without all just foundation in sound policy or sound reason, and that it has too often been made more from necessity than choice, &#8212; rather to escape from an overwhelming analogy, than from any obvious difference in principle in the two classes of cases.\"\n\nBull v. Read, 13 Grat. 78, was decided October, 1855, and involved the constitutionality of an act establishing a free school. Its going into effect was made dependent upon the vote of the several counties. It was objected that its operation and effect having been left dependent upon; a popular vote, rendered the law unconstitutional. But it was held constitutional by the court, Judge Lee\nsaying, &#8212; \"Now, if the legislature may make the operation of its act depend on some contingency thereafter to happen, or may prescribe conditions, it must be for them to judge upon what contingency or what condition the act shall take effect. They must have the power to prescribe any they may think proper; and if the condition be that a vote of approval shall be given by the people affected by the proposed measure, it is difficult to see why it may not be as good and valid as any other condition whatever. . . . To say in such a case that the act is made by the voters and not by the legislature, is to disregard all proper distinctions, and involves all utter confusion of ideas upon this subject. Whenever the contingency upon which a law is to take effect depends upon the act of third persons, it might be said, with equal truth, that the law was enacted by those persons instead of by the legislature.\n\n. . . That its operation should depend upon the result of the vote is as much a part of the legislative will as any other of its provisions, and there can be no difference in principle depending on the nature of the event or contingency upon which the act is to take effect, though the differences in kind and degree may be without end.\"\n\nThe Michigan case is People v. Collins,  3 Mich. 343 , decided in 1854. This involved the constitutionality of a liquor law: the time it was to go into effect, or whether it was to go into effect at all, was left to be determined by a vote of the people. The court were equally divided, four holding it constitutional, while four others held it unconstitutional. This is no decision of the question (Railroad v. Railroad,  50 N.H. 166 ), and consequently it is not an authority either way.\n\nC. W.  Z. R. R. v. Com'rs,  1 Ohio St. 77 ; Peck v. Weddell, 17 Ohio St. 271 . In the first case, a law permitting the people of a county to subscribe for railroad stock, if the majority of voters decided in favor of it, was held constitutional. From the court's opinion, Judge Ladd, in the brief he furnished for the defendant, quoted; and immediately following that quotation, we quote the following: \"But while this is so plain as to be admitted, we think it equally undeniable that the complete exercise of legislative power by the general assembly does not necessarily require the act to so apply its provisions to the subject-matter as to compel their employment without the intervening assent of other persons, or to prevent their taking effect only upon the performance of the conditions expressed in the law.\" The second case is as to the constitutional right of the legislature to pass a law making the removal of a courthouse dependent upon the popular vote. The court held the law constitutional. We fail to discover anything in either case adverse to our position, but, on the contrary, so far as either is all authority upon the question at bar, it is an authority for the plaintiff.\n\nThe Missouri cases are State v. Scott,  17 Mo. 521  (1853); State v. Field, 17 Mo. 529  (1853); State v. Wilcox,  45 Mo. 458  (1870);\nState v. Linn Co. Court,  44 Mo. 504  (1869). The first case cited involved the constitutionality of a law authorizing towns to subscribe for railroad stock, if the town should so decide by vote. It was held constitutional. In State v. Field it was held that a law creating a new county, by vote of the people who were to constitute it, was constitutional. In State v. Wilcox, a school law, to go into effect upon a vote of the different school-districts, was held constitutional. State v. Linn Co. Court, supra. This simply involved the validity of a law authorizing towns, if so decided by a popular vote, to aid in constructing a railroad. The law was held constitutional. It will be seen, then, that these cases, so far as they are at all applicable to the question here raised, sustain the plaintiff.\n\nCheaney v. Hooser, 9 B. Mon. 330, was decided 1848. This simply involved the constitutional power of the legislature to confer upon a local corporation the power of taxation. It was held that the legislature had such power. We cite, as sustaining our view, Commonwealth v. Weller, 14 Bush. 218 (1878). This was upon the constitutionality of a liquor law submitted to the people. It was held constitutional. The fourth section of the act provided \"that this act shall take effect whenever it shall be ratified by a majority of the voters of said county voting thereon at any election in said county.\" In this case, Prior, C. J., said, &#8212; \"The popular will, expressed for or against the provisions of the law, does not, in any manner, destroy or affect the legislative intent. The law was enacted in order that the people of Bullitt county might accept or reject its provisions, and it was in force and effectual as a law for that purpose when it left the hands of the executive with his approval. The law was then perfect in all its parts, and could be enforced without any other legislation. This character of legislation has been sanctioned by the courts of this state and indulged in by the representatives of the people since the formation of the state government. The construction of the language of the act before us is, that it is to take effect like any other law. When it passed the legislature and was signed by the executive, it then became a law, and, by reason of the law, the people interested in its passage were authorized to vote for or against its provisions. That its operation is made to depend on the popular will is a part of the law itself, and its going into operation on the contingency that the people voted for it, was the legislative will on the subject.\" The court cites approvingly Bull v. Read, supra, and Marshall v. Donovan, 10 Bush. (Ky.) 681.\n\nState v. O'Neill,  24 Wis. 149 ; Smith v. Janesville,  26 Wis. 291 . The first case was decided in February, 1869. In it was involved the constitutionality of a law which provided for a board of public works for the city of Milwaukee, providing the people of the city, by a majority vote, accepted it. It was contended that this reference to the people was a delegation of legislative authority, and rendered the act unconstitutional. This position was not sustained,\nand the act was held constitutional. This case criticises the doctrine of Barto v. Himrod, supra, and denies it as an authority. The latter case, Smith v. Janesville, was decided in 1870, and involved the constitutionality of an act of the legislature, which provided that it was not to take effect unless approved by the people of the state. As to the objection that such reference of it to the people was unconstitutional, the court said, &#8212; \"This was no more than providing that the act should take effect on the happening of a certain future contingency, that contingency being a popular vote in its favor. No one doubts the general power of the legislature to make such regulations and conditions as it pleases with regard to the taking effect or operation of laws. They may be absolute, or conditional and contingent; and if the latter, they may take effect on the happening of any event which is future and uncertain. . . . It being conceded that the legislature possesses this general power, the only question here would seem to be whether a vote of the people in favor of a law is to be excluded from the number of those future contingent events upon which it may be provided that it shall take effect. A similar question was before this court in a late case (State v. O'Neill supra), and was very elaborately discussed. We came unanimously to the conclusion, in that case, that a provision for a vote of the electors of the City of Milwaukee in favor of an act of the legislature before it should take effect was a lawful contingency, and the act was valid. That was an act affecting the people of Milwaukee particularly, while this was one affecting the people of the whole state. There the law was submitted to the voters of that city, and here it was submitted to those of the state at large. What is the difference between the two cases? It is manifest, on principle, there cannot be any. The whole reasoning in that case goes to show that this act must be valid, as will be seen by reference to that opinion.\" This is an especially important authority, because the court meet and settle the question that, in principle, there is no constitutional difference between a contingency dependent upon the action of the people of a school-district, town, city, county, or members of a corporation, and that of the people of a state. The court say, &#8212; \"It is manifest, on principle, there cannot be any.\"\n\nPaterson v. Society, 4 Zab. 385; State v. Morris, 36 N. J. (7 Vroom.) 72. In the first case it is held that submitting a charter to the acceptance of the people is not the delegation of legislative authority. This was decided in February, 1854, and it discusses Parker v. Commonwealth and Rice v. Foster, supra, but neither directly approves or denies the doctrine settled by them. The second case was decided in 1872. The local option license law, which provided for granting license upon a vote of the people, was held constitutional. So far as either of these cases bears upon the question under discussion, they sustain the plaintiff's view. They certainly are not authority for the defendant's position.\n\nMaize v. The State,  4 Ind. 343 ; R. R. Co. v. Geiger,  34 Ind. 185 . The first case involved the constitutionality of a local option law. It was decided in 1853. The law was held unconstitutional under a special clause of the constitution of Indiana: \"Local laws for the punishment of offenders, and for the regulation of county and township business, are expressly forbidden.\" Sec. 22 of art. 4, Ind. Const. It is in conflict with our own case of State v. Noyes, decided two years later. This case is also criticised by the court, and somewhat questioned, in Groesch v. The State, 42 Ind. 558 . After saying that it is not necessary, in the case there under discussion, to either approve or overrule Maize v. State, the court say, &#8212; \"It may be remarked, however, that there are several cases [and then cites 24 Barb. 446,  28 N.Y. 605 , Locke's Appeal, supra,  21 Vt. 456 , and case in 36 N. J. 72 ] where legislation similar to the statute of 1853, which was in question in the Maize case, has been held to be constitutional and valid.\" This case was decided in 1873, twenty years later than the Maize case. It will be seen, then, that this case is not only in conflict with our own case, decided two years after, but, twenty years after it was decided, is questioned by the court that made it. This can be given but little if any weight against the constitutionality of this law. The case in  34 Ind. 185 , decided in 1870, simply involved the constitutionality of a law authorizing a county to subscribe for railroad stock if a majority of the voters so decided. This was held constitutional, and, so far as it goes, supports the plaintiff's position.\n\nThe Iowa cases cited by the defendant are Santo v. State, supra; Morford v. Unger,  8 Iowa 82 ; Geebrick v. State, supra; State v. Beneke, supra. Santo v. State involved the constitutionality of a license law, which was referred to the people of the state for acceptance or rejection. The court held the act unconstitutional upon the authority of Parker v. Commonwealth, then practically and now absolutely overruled by the court which made it. Rice v. Foster, which is in direct conflict with and was repudiated by our own court in State v. Noyes in 1865; and the New York cases, which were denied at home by some of the New York courts at least, as we have already shown. The cases of Geebrick v. State and State v. Beneke, supra, both held local option liquor laws unconstitutional. These decisions were based upon the case of Santo v. State, supra, and the Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New York cases there cited. Both of these cases are in conflict with State v. Noyes. Morford v. Unger does not raise this question, or any question of a similar character, as we read it.\n\nAlcorn v. Hamer, supra (1860), involved the constitutionality of a law authorizing the taxation of the inhabitants of certain designated counties, but providing for its submission to the people to be voted on first. The law was held constitutional. It is very difficult, we submit, to see how this can sustain the defendant in his claim. If it bears either way, it is against him.\n\nGorham v. Springfield, supra (1842), is a pauper case, and we have searched in vain to find even the most remote allusion to this question, or any one like it. In this connection, however, it may be said that the general prohibitory law of Maine, submitted to and accepted by the people of Maine in 1858, has undergone all sorts of criticisms and questions; but no one has yet, so far as the reports of that state show, been bold enough, or lynx-eyed enough, to question its constitutionality because submitted to the people.\n\nPeople v. Reynolds, supra (1848). The act, the constitutionality of which was here questioned, provided for the division of Gallatin county, if so voted by a majority of the people. It was contended that its reference to the people, or taking effect upon their action, rendered it invalid. But it was held constitutional. In this case the court said, &#8212; \"To establish the unconstitutionality of this act, it is assumed that, instead of being a law finished and obligatory from the hands of the general assembly, this is merely a bill prepared by that department of the government, and submitted to the people of Gallatin county, to be by them passed into a law, or defeated at the polls. This assumption is not true in fact. The law, as passed, was complete and perfect, although its principal provisions were to take effect upon a contingency, the determination of which did not depend upon the exercise of legislative powers by the people, but upon an expression they were authorized to make, rather in the execution than in the enactment of the law, an expression to be made in a legitimate and ordinary way. . . . It is easy to say that it is the business of the legislature to make laws; but then we must inquire, What kind of laws may be made? Must they be full, complete, perfect, absolute, depending upon no contingency, and conferring no discretion? This would be absolute legislation, exhausting legislative power on the subject-matter of the law. We presume that nowhere has constitutional learning advanced so far as to assert this doctrine.\" In this case the court fully reviews the cases of Parker v. Commonwealth, supra, and Rice v. Foster, supra, and denies them as authority. The doctrine of this case of People v. Reynolds was in 1869 affirmed by the highest court of Illinois in People v. Salomon,  51 Ill. 54 . And both decisions were, in 1876, affirmed by the same court in Guild, Jr., v. Chicago,  82 Ill. 476 . Illinois, then, may be said to sustain fully our position.\n\nState v. Swisher,  17 Tex. 441  (1856), holds a local option law unconstitutional. But before the case was decided the law was repealed; and therefore the court, in Judge Liscomb's opinion, said, &#8212; \"The question presented is not now of very general interest, as the act, whether constitutional or not, has been repealed. We shall, therefore, not give to it the elaborate investigation that we would otherwise have felt called on to bestow on it.\" This decision is worth but little for any purpose, the court giving it\nconfessing that no proper investigation was made. There is another feature of it which adds to its unreliability as an authority: the attorney-general claimed to have collected all the authorities upon the subject, and yet State v. Noyes, decided by our court the year before, and which is directly in conflict with decision, was not cited.\n\nBrown v. Copeland,  3 R.I. 33 , has no application. The law in question was one which provided for the repeal of a law on the affirmative vote of the people. That was legislation. No one pretends that the people can repeal a law.\n\nHobart v. Supervisors,  17 Cal. 23  (1860); Ex parte Wall, supra (1874); People v. Nally,  49 Cal. 478  (1875). In the first case, the question was, Is a law constitutional which authorizes a county to purchase railroad bonds, if the town, by a majority vote, so decide? It was held constitutional. The court said, &#8212; \"The legislature frame the law, and fix its terms and provisions; but they declare that this law shall only take effect in a particular event, that event being the assent of the people interested.\" In Ex parte Wall the court held unconstitutional a liquor license law which was to take effect upon the vote of the people of the town desiring license. This is in conflict with our own case of State v. Noyes, and is the decision of a bare majority of the court. Two of the judges dissented. This case is also practically overruled by People v. Nally. In this case, the act in question provided for the annexation of the territory constituting the county of Klamath to the counties of Siskiyou and Humboldt, if the popular vote of the people of Klamath favored it. This act was held constitutional, and its reference to the voters was not a delegation of legislative power. The court said, &#8212; \"Whilst it is undoubtedly true that there is a considerable conflict in the authorities on the question whether an act of the legislature, which is to take effect or not, as it may be determined by the popular vote, is a delegation of the law-making power, I think the weight of authority, in this state and elsewhere, fully supports the negative of the proposition.\" We may confidently set California down as supporting our view now.\n\nThe Massachusetts authorities recognize the same legislative power to enact laws, the operation of which may depend upon a popular vote. Com. v. Bennett,  108 Mass. 28 ; Com. v. Dean,  110 Mass. 358 ; Stone v. Charlestown, 114 Mass. 221 . In the latter case it was held that \"A statute uniting two municipalities, and providing that the act shall not take full effect unless accepted by the voters of the respective municipalities, is not unconstitutional as a delegation of legislative power.\"\n\nFor further authorities in support of our position, we ask attention to Fell v. State,  42 Md. 71  (1875), State v. Cooke,  24 Minn. 247  (1877). These authorities fully sustain the view that the voters, in respect to a law the operation or going into effect of which depends upon their action, are not exercising legislative\nprivileges, but are simply agents in determining a contingency, on the occurrence of which the law goes into operation. The voters have nothing to do with the passage or enactment of the law, &#8212; simply with its effect and operation. Upon a full review of all the authorities bearing upon this subject, it is submitted that the constitutionality of this act is not even doubtful. The more the question is studied, the more manifest it becomes that the action of the people was simply a determination of a contingency by open, fair, and legitimate means. The constitution nowhere prohibits such means to determine a contingency. The constitution nowhere prohibits the passage of a law the operation of which depends upon a contingency. In the passage of laws, the legislature is granted broad latitude. It is authorized to \"establish all manner of wholesome and reasonable orders, laws, statutes,\" with no restrictions except when \"repugnant or contrary\" to the constitution. Where is the constitutional provision which prohibits the legislature from making the people agents to determine a contingency upon the happening of which a law is to go into operation? It is nowhere to be found. And in addition to this, as said by Bartol, C. J., in Fell v. State, supra, &#8212; \"Every intendment ought to be made in support of the legislative enactment, and it is not to be declared invalid except for the plainest and most conclusive reasons.\" As said by the court, in Perry v. Keene,  56 N.H. 530 , \"All questions of mere expediency, and all questions respecting the just operation of the law, within the limits prescribed by the constitution, were settled by the legislature when it was enacted. The court have only to place the statute and the constitution side by side, and say whether there is such a conflict between the two that they cannot stand together.\" But the statute, as we have before seen, to be pronounced unconstitutional, must plainly appear to be in conflict with the organic law; otherwise it must be upheld.\n\nII. Even if it was admitted by the plaintiff, or determined by the court, that the reference of section one to the people, as contemplated by sections two and three, was unwarranted by the constitution, that would not establish the unconstitutionality of section one. Because, unless January 15, 1881, was determined as the time section one should go into effect in a constitutional way, then, in contemplation of the law and the constitution, no time was limited for section one to take effect, and it therefore took effect September 15, 1879. G. L., c. 1, s. 36. And we take the position that unless its reference to the people was constitutional, the act took \"effect on the fifteenth day of September next following\" its passage by the legislature. An act, part of which is unconstitutional and part constitutional, will be upheld by the court to the extent of the constitutional part. From this act eliminate all the defendant claims to be unconstitutional, and there is left a complete law in all its parts; no time being fixed, or no\nconstitutional mode for fixing a time being prescribed, the time it goes into effect is governed by the general law.\n\nIII. The defendant says this act interferes with the vested rights of the stockholders, and is therefore unconstitutional. He says that, under the reserved right of alternation, amendment, or modification of the charter, or any of it's provisions, the legislature cannot, by a general law, either alter, amend, or modify this charter, or any of its provisions, the legislature cannot, by general law, either alter, amend, or modify this charter, or any of its provisions. The right is reversed by the legislature in the broadest and most comprehensive terms, viz., \"and that the legislature may at any time hereafter alter, amend, or modify this act, or any of its provisions.\" The right of amendment was not only reversed, but also the right to alter or modify any of its provisions. The legislature, in this charter, did not contract to notify the corporation, as suggested in one of the defendant's briefs, in case it contemplated an exercise of its reserved right. A general act of the legislature, under the reserved power, has the effect to alter, amend, or modify a private act. Pierce Railroads 10; Bangor, Oldtown  M. R. R. v. Smith,  47 Me. 34 ; City of Roxbury v. Providence R. R., 6 Cush. 431; Mechanics and Traders Bank v. Bridges,  30 N. J. Law 112 ; State v. Com'r R. Taxation, 37, N. J. Law 230; Dist. v. Whitehead,  13 N. J. Eq. 290 ; Daw v. Metropolitan Board of Works, 12 C. B. N. S. 161; Company v. Clarke, 13 C B. N. S. 838. \"A special charter may, under the reserved power, be repealed by a general law.\" Pierce Railroads 10; Bank v. Bridges, supra. \"The question is always one of legislative intent; and the intent to abrogate the particular enactment in an earlier statute by a general enactment in a later statute is sufficiently manifested where the provisions of the enactments are so inconsistent that they cannot stand together.\" State v. Com'rs, supra. \"A clause in a private act of parliament, which is quite inconsistent with a clause in a subsequent public act dealing with the same subject, is thereby repealed.\" Company v. Clarke, supra; &#8212; see, also Com. v. Liquors, 115 Mass. 154 ; Railroad v. Railway,  118 Mass. 293 . The defendant claims that the case of Hays v. Commonwealth, 82 Penn St. 518, sustains him. An examination of this case, it is submitted, will clearly demonstrate that it does not sustain him. It was the application of a constitutional provision, adopted subsequent to the creation of the corporation, that was involved in that case. It was held by the court that the provision of the constitution did not apply, because existing corporations were \"excluded by the very terms of that instrument.\" And the court say, &#8212; \"It might apply to a legislative enactment attempting to alter this charter, but it cannot apply to this case, arising as it does directly on the constitution itself, for it is excluded by the very terms of that instrument.\" This is not an authority for the position that a general act cannot alter or modify the provisions of a private act.\n\nIV. The defendant denies the right to multiply the number of\nshares by the number of directors to be chosen, if a shareholder casts all his votes for one. The language of the defendant's first brief upon this point is, &#8212; \"It is quite evident, however, that the minority law does not confer the right, as it makes no mention of a multiplier or multiplicand, and it does not in terms increase the number of votes a stockholder may cast.\" We adopt the language of the Pennsylvania court, in answering a similar position in Hays v. Commonwealth, supra. \"This section is understood to confer upon the individual stockholder the right to cast all the votes which his stock represents, multiplied by the number of directors or managers to be elected, should he think proper to do so. Though from this section, as originally proposed, words nearly similar to those we have used were stricken out, yet we have no doubt we have in our statement embodied the intention of the convention. If, indeed, we do not in this manner reach the meaning of this part of the constitution, it has none; for it would be a vain thing to propose to confer a power upon members of a corporation which they already possessed.\"\n\nV. The defendant contends that the relator has waived his right to a directorship by reason of his proper conduct in the meeting. It was not necessary that the relator should be boisterous and loud in his protestations and claims, or make them himself. It was sufficient for him to be represented in an orderly manner by two lawyers, Messrs. Copeland and Lyford, whose purpose was to protect his rights and insist upon them. It could hardly be said that a prisoner, while in court, before trial began, had waived his right to a fair trial by his personal silence and proper conduct. The relator, through his counsel at this meeting, where the majority of the stock-owners designed a disregard of this act, asked \"how the votes for Mr. Pearson were cast, &#8212; one or seven for every share.\" To which the reply made was \"that the votes had been cast, and the record would be made.\" And Mr. Copeland made a still more direct inquiry, viz., \"if he or they were to understand that the minority representation law had been disregarded.\" To this \"the chairman answered that it had not, and that the records of the vote would be made.\" \"Mr. Copeland further inquired if seven votes had been cast for Mr. Pearson on every share of stock that was voted for him, to which question there was no answer.\" What more could Mr. Pearson do, or could be done for him? Declamation was useless; the result had been determined upon; protestation was futile; inquiries had ceased to provoke answers. There was left no alternative but silence and submission for the time, and an appeal to another tribunal.\n\nWm. Power Wilson, in reply. That the maxim delegata potestas non potest delegari applies as well to delegated public authority as to delegated private authority, has been recognized, not only in those cases where the principle has been sustained, but also in\nthose where the applicability thereof has been denied. It will not be seriously contended, should a governor allow the electors of the state to decide whether a criminal, convicted of a capital crime, should be pardoned or executed, or should a court of justice render a decision allowing the electors to decide whether judgment should be entered for the plaintiff or for the defendant, that in the first case a pardon so granted would be efficacious, or that in the second case a title derived under such a judgment would be of much value. The defendant contends that the same principle applies to the power to make laws cannot be delegated by the legislature to any persons or collection of persons, any more than can the powers delegated to the executive or judicial authorities be delegated by them. And we would not fail in discerning \"the plain distinction between the exercise of legislative power in framing and enacting laws, and the exercise of an altogether different and foreign but subordinate power in producing the event or result upon which such enactment is to take effect,\" the distinction being as evident as that between a conditional judgment and a judgment which is to take effect according as the electors may decide. The principle that the legislature cannot delegate its legislative authority has been relied upon in numerous cases, and it has almost as frequently been decided that in the enactment then before the court there had not been such a delegation. But what, then, was the nature of these enactments?\n\nFirst, we will consider that class of cases where the legislature has passed an act incorporating a city or village, or dividing a county, or amending a city charter, or removing a county-seat, provided it should not take effect unless the electors adopted its provisions. In Paterson v. Society, 4 Zab. 385, where the legislature, having incorporated the city of Paterson, provided that the act should not go into effect unless assented to by a majority of the electors of the township of Paterson, it was urged that this act was unconstitutional as being a delegation of legislative authority. Green, C. J., in delivering the opinion of the court, says, &#8212; \"It is conceded as indisputable, &#8212; I. That as well by the fundamental theory of a representative democracy as by the express provision of the constitutions of the states of the Union, legislation cannot be exercised directly by the people. II. That the legislative power cannot be delegated; that it can only be exercised by the functionaries and in the mode designated and prescribed in the constitution. III. That a law enacted by any other authority, or in any other mode than that prescribed by the constitution, is void. . . . The question submitted by the act to the inhabitants of the district was submitted to them not as a part of the sovereign people, but simply as corporators. Nor was the question upon the expediency of the statute or of any particular provision of the charter, but simply whether they would accept the charter tendered to\nthem by the legislature. Their vote was an act of acceptance, not of legislation. . . . The acceptance of a charter by the vote of a municipal corporation is no more an act of legislation than the acceptance of a charter by the votes of the members of a private corporation.\" In People v. Reynolds, 5 Gil. 1, the legislature had authorized the division of Gallatin county, subject to the approval of a majority of the voters, and it was objected that this act was a delegation of legislative authority. But Caton, J., in delivering the opinion of the court, says, &#8212; \"A law may depend upon a future event or contingency for its taking effect, and that contingency may arise from the voluntary act of others. Of this class are all laws creating private corporations, and a very large proportion of the laws creating public or municipal corporations. . . . All such laws are perfect and complete when they leave the hands of the legislature, although a future event shall determine whether they can take effect or not. . . . The legislature may grant ferry licenses, or it may lay out roads, and specify their routes and bounds; and yet who will doubt that it may delegate this power to others, either by general or special laws? So, also, it may pass the laws requisite for the government of a particular city, or township, or school-district; and who will doubt the propriety of its authorizing this to be done by the people within the limits of the city, town, or district, by their local representatives, or even directly?\" In Commonwealth v. Quarter-Sessions, 8 Penn. St. 391, a new township had been erected out of a portion of an old township, and the legislature directed an election to be held to determine whether the new township should be continued or annulled. Bell, J., in delivering the opinion of the court, says, &#8212; \"The erection of a township or the creation of a new district for merely municipal purposes, or convenience in the transaction of the public business, is in no degree similar to the exercise of the law-making power. The one is an exercise of sovereignty; the other, in its very nature, a subordinate function. The latter, like the laying out of a public road or highway, or the erection of a bridge, may require the exercise of judgment and ability; but there is nothing either in the positive provisions of our constitutions, or the genius of our institutions, which prohibits the action of other than legislative bodies. . . . It has never been imagined that it bore any resemblance to the power of enacting laws.\" In Stone v. Charlestown,  114 Mass. 214 , another case where a statute uniting certain municipalities was not to take effect unless accepted by the voters of the respective municipalities, Gray, C. J., in delivering the opinion of the court, says, &#8212; \"The power to alter the boundaries of counties, towns, and cities . . . is an inherent attribute of the legislature, to be exercised according to its own views of public expediency, unless restrained by constitutional provision.\" In Chandler v. Boston,  112 Mass. 200 , where a similar question arose, Colt, J., in delivering the opinion of the court, says, &#8212; \"The control\nof the general court over territorial divisions of the state into cities, towns, and districts, unless controlled by some specific constitutional limitation, must necessarily be supreme. It is incident to that sovereign power which regulates the performance of public and political duties.\" See, also, Smith v. McCarthy, 56 Penn. St. 359; Commonwealth v. Painter, 10 Penn. St. 214; State v. Scott,  17 Mo. 521 ; People v. Nally,  49 Cal. 478 ; Morford v. Unger,  8 Iowa 82 ; Corning v. Greene, 23 Barb. 33; Bank of Chenango v. Brown,  26 N.Y. 467 .\n\nFrom these authorities it appears that acts of this nature do not derive their validity from the power delegated to the legislature to make laws, but from that power of sovereignty which is inherent in the legislature.\n\nUpon the same principle are those acts sustained wherein the legislature has made the assessment of a tax depend upon the votes of the electors, and they include those cases where the electors have voted to subscribe to a railroad, or to erect a separate free-school system, or to establish a park, or some other public work. In C. W.  Z. R. R. v. Com'rs, 1 Ohio St. 77 , the legislature authorized the commissioners to subscribe to the capital stock of the plaintiff company, and to issue bonds of the county, or to borrow the money wherewith to make the subscription good, and empowered them to levy a tag annually to create a sinking-fund to meet the obligations, but provided that the question of subscription was to be submitted to the electors of the county. It was objected that the act was unconstitutional, as being a delegation of legislative authority; but Ranney, J., in delivering the opinion of the court, after recognizing the principle that legislative authority could not be delegated, continued, &#8212; \"But while this is so plain as to be admitted, we think it equally undeniable that the complete exercise of legislative power by the general assembly does not necessarily require the act to so apply its provisions to the subject-matter as to compel their employment without the intervening assent of other persons, or to prevent their taking effect only upon the performance of conditions expressed in the law. Thus, county commissioners are authorized, but not required, to erect public buildings, and to erect and establish poor-houses, and to levy taxes for these purposes. The school laws of this state have always allowed householders and resident tax-payers of school-districts to determine, by vote, upon the erection of schoolhouses and the imposition of the necessary taxes for the purpose. Of the same character is the law which leaves to the citizens of each township to decide upon the erection of a town-house &#8212; while every act of incorporation ever passed necessarily refers the question of its acceptance to the corporators &#8212; these all present cases where the discretion is left to the body of those interested or to be affected.\" In People v. Saloman, 51 Ill. 37 , the legislature provided for the establishment of a park, and the assessment of a tax (to be levied\nwith other taxes) for the maintenance of the same, but made the entire scheme to depend upon the votes of the electors in the towns wherein the park was situated. The same objection being taken, Breese, C. J., delivering the opinion of the court, says, &#8212; \"If the legislature has power, for any purpose they may deem beneficial, to abstract from the powers they have granted to a municipal corporation and to curtail their territorial jurisdiction, what reason can be urged why they should not, with the assent of the people to be affected by the measure, place over them an authority for a special purpose with the powers granted to the relators?\" The statute is accordingly held constitutional, as within People v. Reynolds, supra. In State v. O'Neill,  24 Wis. 149 , where the legislature had established a board of public works in Milwaukee, but provided it should be void unless accepted by a majority of the electors, Cole, J., in delivering the opinion of the court, says, &#8212; \"This is a complete enactment in itself; it requires nothing to perfect it as a law; while it is only left to the people to be affected by it to determine whether they will avail themselves of its provisions. The legislature may refer questions of local government, including police regulations, to the local authorities.\" See, also, Lafayette R. R. v. Geiger,  34 Ind. 185 ; Alcorn v. Hamer,  38 Miss. 652 ; Bull v. Read, 13 Grat. 78; State v. Wilcox,  45 Mo. 458 ; Hudson Co. v. State, 4 Zab. 718; State v. Linn Co. Court,  44 Mo. 504 , Hobart v. Supervisors, 17 Cal. 23 ; Bank of Rome v. Village,  18 N.Y. 38 ; Clarke v. Rochester, 28 N.Y. 605 ; State v. Tryon,  39 Conn. 183 . And the same principle applies although the statute authorizes a general tax, and submits the question as to its adoption to the electors throughout the state. Smith v. Janesville, 26 Wis. 291 .\n\nIt is said in State v. O'Neill, supra, that the legislature may refer \"police regulations\" to the local authorities. What are these police regulations that apparently fall within this principle, that they do not derive their validity from the law-making authority, but from that sovereign authority inherent in the legislature? In Pierce v. The State, 13 N.H. 536  (1843), Parker, C. J., says, &#8212; \"It [this police power] has relation to the peace, security, and happiness of the community, and may provide for the prevention and punishment of offences, the prevention of pauperism and idle and dissolute habits, the preservation and promotion of industry and economy, health and morals,\" and it would apparently embrace the regulation of the sale of ardent spirits, and the use of firearms, gunpowder, fire-crackers, the observance of the Sabbath, and quarantine rules. And it is upon this principle that in State v. Noyes, 30 N. H[.] 279 (1855), an act of the legislature regulating the use of bowling-alleys, but which was to take effect in those towns only which should adopt its provisions, was held constitutional. Bell, J., in delivering the opinion of the court, says, &#8212; \"It seems to be generally conceded that powers of local legislation may be granted to cities, towns, and other municipal\ncorporations. If the legislature can confer the power of local legislation upon such municipalities, they certainly can leave the provisions of an act drafted by themselves to their adoption or acceptance.\"\n\nIt is also upon this doctrine of \"police regulations\" that the \"local option\" acts can be supported, if at all. There has been much diversity of opinion upon the validity of those enactments which have allowed the electors in the several municipalities to determine by vote whether the license laws should be enforced or not, the earlier decisions being strongly opposed to the validity of such acts as being a delegation of legislative authority; but it would seem that the better opinion is that they are valid as coming within \"police regulations,\" and not coming within the prohibition of a delegated legislative authority. In State v. Morris Co., 7 Vroom 72, the legislature had provided that from the passage of the act persons should not sell liquor without license, but allowed the electors in the different towns to determine whether licenses should be granted or not. Van Sykel, J., in delivering the opinion of the court, says, &#8212; \"The right of the legislature to grant the power of local government to municipalities is conceded. Under authority to establish police regulations, municipal corporations may be invested with power to make ordinances to promote the health and contribute to the safety of the community. It would not be pretended that authority could be delegated to the corporate body to pronounce how real estate should descend, or personal property be distributed, within the city limits.\" In Locke's Appeal, 72 Penn. St. 491, the act in question made the granting of licenses in a certain ward of Philadelphia depend upon a majority vote of the electors. Agnew, J., in delivering the opinion of the court, after admitting that the legislature stands in the relation of agent to the people, and cannot delegate its authority, continues, &#8212; \"But it is perfectly clear that this law was not made, pronounced, or ratified by the people, and the majority vote is but an ascertainment of the public sentiment, the expression of the general opinion, which, as a fact, the legislature have made the contingency on which the law shall operate. . . . The wit of man cannot draw a well grounded distinction between the result of a vote upon license in a township and the result of a vote upon the existence of a township, and the removal of a court-house, or a subscription to stock, or the consolidation of an outlying district with a city. . . . The law did not spring from the vote, but the vote sprang from the law, and the law alone declared the consequences to flow from the vote.\" See, also, Com. v. Bennett,  108 Mass. 27 ; Gloversville v. Howell,  70 N.Y. 287 .\n\nBut in addition to the authorities already cited, and which may be classified as those conferring municipal regulations, there are others which, though illustrating the same principle, must be differently classified. For instance, it has been decided that congress did not delegate any legislative authority when it authorized the\npresident to call forth the militia, and to specify the period for which the services were required, although the constitution expressly vested the regulation of the army in that body. In re Griner,  16 Wis. 423 . Neither was it considered a delegation of legislative authority when congress authorized the president to suspend the writ of habeas corpus. In re Oliver,  17 Wis. 681 . Nor was there a delegation of legislative authority when congress empowered the United States courts to frame rules regulating its practice. Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 1.\n\nAnd, to take another illustration, it is not considered a delegation of legislative authority for the legislature to allow a corporation to exercise the right of eminent domain. Other illustrations might be cited, but it must be clear, from the authorities we have reviewed at length, that all acts of the legislature are not legislative acts; or, in other words, that the power to make laws is not the only power which the legislature can exercise. What, then, is this power which the legislatures have, and upon what principle is it based, since it is so different from the power to make laws, and may be entrusted to others to execute? It will be found, we submit, that the courts have allowed what we have designated as municipal legislation, upon the theory that acts of this kind are of the same nature as acts incorporating private corporations, which are made to depend upon the assent or acceptance of those to be affected. Paterson v. Society, supra; People v. Reynolds, supra; C. W.  Z. R. R. v. Com'rs, supra. And it is upon a similar ground that acts authorizing taxation, subject to the approval of the electors, and those acts granting police regulations upon a like approval, have been sustained. And it seems that the militia law and the court regulations and the right to suspend the writ of habeas corpus are based upon the same principle, namely, that they do not derive their validity from the legislative power delegated to the legislature, but upon the sovereign power inherent in the legislature. All corporations, both private and public, are created by virtue of the sovereign power. 1 Kyd Corp. 41. The right of eminent domain is likewise inherent in the legislature, and is not conferred, but limited, by the constitution (2 Dillon Mun. Corp., s. 590), both the power of eminent domain and the power of taxation being essentially powers of sovereignty. Brewster v. Hough, 10 N.H. 138 . And the state constitutions (with few exceptions) do not confer this power of taxation, as it is an inherent right of the governing body. Blackwell, Tax-titles, 2. The power also to regulate the health, morality, and welfare of the community (by police regulations) is an attribute of sovereignty inherent in the legislatures. Com. v. Bennett, supra. In other words, those acts which, as we have seen, can be made to depend upon the approval of a third person, are acts which arise from the power of sovereignty inherent in the legislatures, being necessary for the purposes of government; and of these powers a delegation cannot be\npredicated, and a grant thereof is sustained upon the principle qui facit per alium facit per se. But the power to enact laws belongs to the people, and having delegated this power to the legislature, and having confided in the wisdom, integrity, and discretion of their agents, it cannot be used except as authorized by the instrument creating the agency. Therefore the legislature could not enact a law concerning the descent of real or personal property, the statute of frauds, or the statute of limitations, or the rules of evidence, or any of the rules of the commercial law, and allow the people to say whether such provision should become a law. Neither can the legislature delegate to a third person, or a collection of persons, the right to determine whether a certain provision shall be or become a law or not, nor whether a given law shall or shall not be repealed.\n\nBut the doctrine contended for does not rest alone upon a theory, nor is it a mere abstract principle; but it was recognized by Marshall, C. J., who, in the action of Wayman v. Southard, supra, wherein it was objected that the act whereby congress permitted the U.S. courts to regulate their practice was unconstitutional, since it was a delegation of legislative authority, in delivering the opinion of the court, says, &#8212; \"It will not be contended that congress can delegate to the courts, or to any other tribunal, powers which are strictly and exclusively legislative;\" and it has been repeatedly upheld, even in those decisions where its application to the particular act before the court has been denied. C. W.  Z. R. R. v. Com'rs, supra; Paterson v. Society, supra; State v. Beneke,  9 Iowa 203 ; State v. Weir,  33 Iowa 134 ; Barto v. Himrod,  8 N.Y. 489 ; Rice v. Foster, supra; Locke's Appeal, supra; Willis v. Owen,  43 Tex. 41 ; Roos v. Swenson, 6 Minn. 428 .\n\nBut we are not confined solely to those cases where, the principle being admitted, its application was denied; but there are some authorities of an affirmative nature. In Slinger v. Henneman,  38 Wis. 504 , which was an action to recover for injuries inflicted by a dog, the question in dispute was whether the plaintiff could recover without alleging and proving a scienter. Lyon, J., in delivering the opinion of the court, says, &#8212; \"At common law the defendant would not be liable without he were aware of the ferocious or vicious nature of his dog; and this rule is still in practice, unless changed by some statute. The only statute upon the question is known as the \"dog law,\" and it, among other things, provides that the owner of any dog shall be liable without proving notice. In another section it is left with the county board of supervisors to determine whether the county should be exempt or not from this law. It is a settled maxim of constitutional law that the power to make laws, conferred upon the legislature, cannot be delegated by that department to any other body or authority. Yet it is undoubtedly true that in matters purely local and municipal the legislature may enact conditional laws, and refer them to the\npeople or proper municipal authorities to decide whether such laws shall or shall not have force and effect in their respective municipalities. Section 8, however, does not relate to municipal affairs, but it seeks to change a rule of the common law pertaining to a matter of general interest. As well might the legislature authorize the board of supervisors of a county to abolish in such county days of grace on commercial paper, or to suspend the operation of the statute of limitations. Such legislation is clearly within the restriction on the power of the legislature to delegate its authority, and is, therefore, inoperative and void.\"\n\nAnd in State v. Field,  17 Mo. 529 , a statute concerning roads and highways, certain sections of which imposed penalties and provided for their recovery by indictment, authorizing county courts in their discretion to suspend for any specified length of time the operation thereof, and to bring into force a prior statute upon the same subject, was held unconstitutional. Gambel, J., in delivering the opinion of the court, says, &#8212; \"This act, by its own provisions, repeals the inconsistent provisions of a former act, and yet it is left to the county court to say which act shall be in force in their county. The question which is to be passed upon by the county court is whether the new act shall be suspended and the old act revived, and if so, for how long.\" This bears a very strong resemblance to the exercise of legislative power by the county court. Therefore it was held unconstitutional.\n\nIn State v. Young,  29 Minn. 474 ,  551 , the constitution of Minnesota provided that no law levying a tax, or making other provision for the payment of the bonds denominated Minnesota state railroad bonds, shall take effect or be in force until such law shall have been submitted to a vote of the people of the state, and adopted by the majority of the electors of the state voting upon the same. Subsequently the legislature passed an act to provide for taking up these bonds. Section 4 of this act proposes the issue of the new bonds without submission to the vote of the people, and section 5 proposes it to be submitted to the vote of the people; and, in effect, it is left to certain judges of the district court to determine whether the legislature have power, without submitting it to the people, to make the contemplated adjustment. Gilfillan, C. J., in delivering the opinion of the court, says, &#8212; \"It is a principle not questioned that, except where authorized by the constitution, as in respect to municipalities, the legislature cannot delegate legislative power, &#8212; cannot confer on any body or person the power to determine what shall be the law. The legislature only must determine what it shall be. The courts only must authoritatively determine what it is. . . . We regard the act as not only bad in principle, but dangerous as a precedent. If the legislature may submit to others this provision in the constitution as affecting its legislative authority, and make the taking effect of the law depend on the decision, it may, in like manner, refer any other constitutional\nprovision; and as there is nothing to restrain the legislature in its choice of the persons to whose decision it will refer such matters, it may make the reference to any person or persons, without regard to their fitness or qualifications to determine the questions submitted. The fact that their choice happened to fall upon five persons who are judges, inasmuch as the submission is not made to them as a court, and in a judicial manner, cannot affect the right to submit. The selection and reference would be as valid had it fallen upon any other five men. The evils which might grow out of a power in the legislature to thus evade the responsibility of determining its authority to pass laws, or the expediency of passing them, to shift such responsibility to any one it might choose to designate, must be apparent. The act delegates to the judges the power to determine what provisions in it shall be law, &#8212; a power which the legislature itself must exercise, and cannot delegate. It is, therefore, void.\"\n\nThe act in question provides for the regulation of the power of voting in corporations. It derives its validity either from the delegated law-making power, or from the power of government inherent in the legislature. It would seem that it was not intended as a politico-governmental regulation, as, for instance, a police regulation, and does not depend upon that absolute authority which the legislature has over public corporations to create, change, and destroy them at pleasure (Berlin v. Gorham, 34 N.H. 266 ), but that it was intended as a rule affecting the property and rights of the stockholders in corporations. It seems to be identical with a law which should regulate the transfer of stock in corporations, and this would be as much a law as the laws controlling the recording of deeds, concerning the transfer of real or personal estate; in short, it is a law. But there is one other principle which is deducible from the decisions cited, and it is this, &#8212; that although the legislative body may cause a provision to depend upon the votes of electors, yet, nevertheless, in every case it is made to depend upon the votes of those interested, and to be affected thereby. It can hardly be conceived that in the cases cited the enactments would have been sustained had they been made to depend upon the votes of persons not interested: for instance, would those enactments have been sustained wherein a tax was authorized, provided it met the approval of the electors to be affected, had it been made to depend upon the votes of the electors in another county? Would the police regulation mentioned in State v. Noyes have been sustained, had it been made binding in one town, provided another town should so vote? If this provision is not a law, but is, on the contrary, a grant of a privilege, and derives its authority not from the law-making power, but from the power of sovereignty inherent in the legislature, it must be regulated by those rules which regulate matters of like nature. If it is a grant of a private nature, it must be regulated by that rule which says that no private benefits,\nwith their attendant obligations, shall be imposed upon one unless with his consent. Angell  Ames Corp., s. 81, and cases cited. Therefore this provision is unconstitutional, since it imposes upon corporations the minority law provided the sense of the electors in the state should be in favor thereof.\n\nNor will section 1 of this act be sustained, should it be decided that the other sections constituted a delegation of legislative power, unless the court is satisfied that the legislature would have enacted such portion alone had it foreseen that the court would declare the remainder of the act void.

Facts found by a referee. At the June session of the legislature, 1879, an act was passed providing that \"In all elections for directors or managers of a corporation, each member or shareholder may cast the whole number of his votes for one candidate, or distribute them upon two or more candidates, as he may prefer.\" It was further provided that the sense of the voters of the state should be taken, at the biennial election to be holden in the November following, upon the foregoing proposition; and that the same should or should not go into effect and become a law, according to the result of such popular vote. The returns of the vote showed a majority in favor of the proposition: whereupon the governor, in pursuance of a requirement of the act, issued his proclamation stating the result of the vote, and declaring that section one of the\nact, quoted above, would go into effect and become a law January 15, 1881. The governor's proclamation, which recites the act in full, is given in the margin. [fn*] \n\nAt the annual meeting, held May 23, 1881, a resolution was passed to vote for seven directors for the ensuing year upon one ballot; and a committee was appointed to receive, sort, and count the votes, who, after the vote had been taken, reported the whole\nnumber of votes 23,095. Of these, six of the seven persons whose names were upon the same ballot received 18,088 votes each, and the defendant received 17,981. Votes upon 5,114 shares were given in upon ballots which contained no name but that of the relator; and the number of shares voted upon each of those ballots was thereon multiplied by seven. If those products should be counted as votes for the relator, he received 35,798. But the committee counted only the number of shares voted for the relator, and reported that the relator received 5,114 votes. The seven gentlemen who received the largest number of votes counted as above, having received more than the number necessary for a choice, were thereupon declared elected, and the record was so made up.\n\nThe relator was present at the meeting, but made no address or remarks, either to the committee or to the chair, in the nature of suggestion, protest, or otherwise. Upon motion of Mr. Lyford, it was voted that a record be kept of every vote cast, for whom, by whom, and the number of shares for directors, at this meeting. While the vote was being taken, Mr. L. D. Stevens asked the chairman how the votes for Mr. Pearson were cast, one or seven for every share. The chairman replied in substance, that the votes had been cast, and the record would be made. Mr. W. J. Copeland made a similar inquiry, asking if he or they were to understand that the minority representation law had been disregarded. The chairman answered that it had not, and that the records of the vote would be made. Mr. Copeland further inquired if seven votes had been cast for Mr. Pearson on every share of stock that was voted for him, to which question there was no answer made. It appeared from Mr. Lyford's testimony, that he (Lyford) supposed he was acting as attorney for Mr. Pearson, and also supposed Mr. Copeland and Mr. Burke were similarly employed as counsel. Mr. Copeland voted at the meeting as proxy, and Mr. Stevens was a stockholder. Neither gentleman stated that in the inquiries made he was acting as counsel.\n\n  [fn*]                 STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE.\n\nEXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT.\n\nWhereas, on the nineteenth day of July, 1879, was approved the following Act, \"An Act to provide for Minority Representation in Corporations\":\n\nBe it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court convened:\n\nSECT. 1.

{"absolute_url": "/opinion/3574408/burke-v-concord-railroad/", "attorney": "Bingham  Mitchell, for the plaintiffs. The questions here presented originate in a motion for an injunction. The injunction of the defendants\nfrom an execution of the contract of August 19, 1881, is sought. The plaintiffs' right to have this motion granted is founded upon the position that this contract is invalid or illegal for the following reasons:\n\nFirst, it is in violation of the charter of the Concord Railroad.\n\nSecond, it is in violation of the public law of New Hampshire.\n\nThird, it is ultra vires of the directors of the Concord Railroad.\n\nIf either point is sustained, the plaintiffs' motion should be granted.\n\nThree important and essential facts are found by the case either to have been proved, or an offer of proof of them made or admitted by the defendants, viz., &#8212;\n\n(1) The plaintiffs are stockholders of the Concord Railroad.\n\n(2) The contract was made by the defendants.\n\n(3) The execution of the contract has been entered upon by the defendants.\n\nWhat more is necessary? The court have before them the parties, the grievance, and the cause of the grievance. They have also before them, at the same time, the charter, the statute law of New Hampshire, and the common law. These elements constitute a complete case. The reasons for executing the contract; the motives actuating the parties who were instrumental in causing its execution; and its effect, whether it be injurious or beneficial to the interests of the parties affected by it, &#8212; are immaterial, and foreign to the real question involved in this motion, viz., Were the directors of the Concord Railroad, on August 19, 1881, vested with power to bind the Concord Railroad in the execution of this contract?\n\nThe plaintiffs' right to be heard upon the question of the validity or invalidity of this \"business contract only,\" arises from their relation to the corporation whose rights, property, and franchises are being interfered with under it. They and their associates, constituting the corporation, are the owners and masters: the directors are simply their agents and servants. As is said in Koehler v. Black River Falls Co., 2 Black 715, \"The directors are the trustees or managing partners, and the stockholders are the cestuis que trust * * * of the corporation.\" As was said by Judge Woods in Gillis v. Bailey,  21 N.H. 162 , \"The directors of a corporation are merely its agents, and are not the corporation.\" In Tippets v. Walker,  4 Mass. 596 , Parsons, C. J., said, \"the directors are not a corporation, but the agents of one.\" See, also, to the same point, Angell  Ames Corp. 256, et seq.; Pierce on Railroads, 36 et seq. These agents, trustees, or servants have powers and prerogatives that are prescribed and limited, and within which the law compels them to act. When they perform an act beyond the line prescribed, it is not the act of their principal, the corporation, because their agency did not embrace it. And when they do this, they violate their trust. \"Stockholders have a remedy in equity to prevent violations of the charter, or acts ultra vires amounting to a\nbreach of trust, or endangering the existence of the corporation.\" Pierce on Railroads 43. \"Equity will enjoin a corporation and its officers, at the suit of a stockholder, from entering into contracts or engaging in transactions which are in violation of the charter, and involve a breach of trust on the part of the corporation and its officers.\" Pierce on Railroads 520. See, also, Fisher v. Concord Railroad,  50 N.H. 210 ; March v. E. R. R. Co.,  40 N.H. 548  &#8212; S.C.,  43 N.H. 515 ,  531 ,  532 . \"It is the undoubted right of stockholders of a corporation to apply to the courts by action against the corporation itself, upon the diversion or threatened diversion of the corporate funds to purposes unauthorized by their charter, and for breach of duty. * * * As against such stockholders all unauthorized contracts are ultra vires, for which they can claim affirmative interposition of the courts to prevent threatened diversion.\" Potter Law of Corp., s. 555; Dodge v. Woolsey, 18 How. 331.\n\nA corporation is a creature made by a legislative act. The act creates its powers, privileges, and franchises, and restricts and limits them. It is no larger than the chartered design: its rights, powers, and privileges are no more extensive than those specified in \"its source of life,\" &#8212; the charter. It has such powers and such only as are expressly granted to it, or such as are necessarily incidental to those granted. Its incidental powers are such and only such as are directly and immediately essential to the exercise and execution of those powers which are specifically granted, and not such as have a slight or remote relation to those granted. And the rights, powers, and franchises, conferred upon the corporation by its charter, are for itself to use and exercise. It cannot delegate them to others without the expressed consent and authority of the legislature, &#8212; the power creating it. It cannot absolve itself from its duty to use and exercise the privileges granted, by asking or permitting others to do it, even though others may do it as well. It is the corporation, and the corporation alone, upon whom these special and extraordinary privileges are conferred. In consideration of receiving those special and extraordinary advantages, they must not only always use the powers granted, but must always hold themselves in a condition to use and exercise them. Their charter is a contract with the state. It is not assignable or transferable. There are but two parties recognized in it, &#8212; the state and the corporation. That these views and positions are sustained by the law is demonstrated, we submit, by the following authorities: \"A corporation is an artificial being, invisible, intangible, and existing only in contemplation of law. Being the mere creature of law, it possesses only those properties which the charter of its creation confers upon it, either expressly or as incidental to its very existence.\" Opinion of C. J. Marshall in Dart. Coll. v. Woodward, 4 Wheat. 636. \"A corporation is a creature of the law. Deriving its existence and faculties from the express grant of the legislature, it has only the powers so conferred, and all others are\npresumed to have been withheld. That legislative grants to a corporation, whether of powers or exemptions, are to be strictly construed, so that nothing passes except what is given in clear and explicit terms, is a familiar doctrine, which is applied with more stringency when the powers in question interfere with private rights, or abridge important functions of government.\" Pierce on Railroads 491.\n\n\"It is now established beyond question, that not only are the capacities of corporations limited in degree, but so, also, are the purposes and ends for which they propose to employ those capacities. Corporations are created for the accomplishment of certain ends, * * and in this behalf they are endowed with various powers and privileges other than such as are possessed by private persons; but these powers and privileges are given to corporations in a qualified manner only, and not absolutely.\" Green's Brice's Ultra Vires 471. \"Corporations are creatures of the legislature, having no other powers than such as are given to them by their charters, or such as are incidental or necessary to carry into effect the purposes for which they were established.\" Downing v. Mt. Washington Road Co., 40 N.H. 232 ; Trustees v. Peaslee,  15 N.H. 330 ; Perrine v. Chesapeake Canal Co., 9 How. 172. \"A corporation has only such powers as are specifically granted, or such as are necessary for carrying the former into effect; and these powers can only be exercised for the purposes contemplated by the charter.\" Brightly's Fed. Dig., tit. Corp.; Beaty v. Knowler, 4 Pet. 152; Farnum v. Blackstone Co., 1 Sumn. 46. \"A corporation can do no acts, within or without the state which created it, except such as are authorized by its charter.\" Brightly's Fed. Dig., tit. Corp.; Bank v. Earle, 13 Pet. 519; R. R. Co. v. Kneeland, 4 How. 16; Runyan v. Lessee, 14 Pet. 122. \"It is familiar law, that a corporation possesses such powers, and such only, as the law of its creation confers upon it.\" Franklin Co. v. Lewiston Sav. Inst.,  68 Me. 43 . In this case, the defendants undertook to buy stock, and pledged the bank's credit, but it was held to be beyond their power. See, also, Bank v. Agency Co.,  24 Conn. 159 ; Berry v. Yates, 24 Barb. 199. \"Corporations can make no contracts which are not necessary, either directly or indirectly, to effect the objects of their creation.\" Abbott v. Steam Packet Co., 1 Md. Ch. 642; Kitchen v. Cape Girardeau R. R., 59 Mo. 514 . A corporation chartered to boom lumber cannot drive lumber. Boom Corp. v. Whiting,  29 Me. 123 . \"The modern doctrine is to consider corporations as having such powers as are specifically granted by the act of incorporation, or are necessary for the purpose of carrying into effect the powers granted, and as not having any other.\" 2 Potter Corp. 652. What are recognized as the incidental powers of corporations may be gathered from the following: \"Such powers only are implied as are necessary and incidental to the express powers and are within the scope and purposes of the charter.\" Pierce on Railroads\n515. \"An incidental power is one that is directly and immediately appropriate to the execution of the specific power granted, and not one that has a slight or remote relation to it.\" Hood v. N. Y.  N.H. R. R., 22 Conn. 16 ; Curtis v. Leavitt,  15 N.Y. 127 ; Buffett v. T.  B. R. R., 40 N.Y. 176 ; Beaty v. Knowler, supra.\n\nWhat powers were granted the Concord Railroad by the legislature? To answer this, we must go to the charter. \"In determining the extent of the power of a corporation, whether municipal or private, to make contracts, and what contracts are within that power and what are ultra vires and void, it becomes necessary to examine the mode in which the power is to be exercised. This demands a careful study of the charter of the incorporating act, and the general legislation of the state on the subject, if there be any.\" 2 Potter Law of Corp. 652.\n\n(1) It is not pretended that this contract has the sanction of any express legislative act, under s. 2 of c. 159 of Gen. Laws: \"No sale, lease, mortgage, or contract for the use of any railroad shall be valid unless it shall be in writing, filed in the office of the secretary of state, and authorized by the legislature.\" It is not a contract by virtue of this law. Neither is it claimed that the parties to this \"business contract only\" so far observed the law of the state as to procure either the sanction of the railroad commissioners, or its approval by the governor and council.\n\n\"No contract between two or more railroad corporations, for the use of their roads, shall be legal or binding for a longer time than five years, nor unless sanctioned in writing by the railroad commissioners and approved by the governor and council.\" Gen. Laws, c. 164, s. 101.\n\nThe signers of this contract, it is true, call it \"a business contract only;\" but the statute permits \"no * * contract for the use of any railroad\" to be made in this way. G. L., c. 159, s. 2. \"No contract between two or more railroad corporations, for the use of their roads, shall be legal,\" etc. This includes \"business\" contracts, when it is a contract for the use of a road or roads. \"The joint management herein provided for shall have * * the entire control of the roads of each party, their shops, depots, furniture, rolling stock, machinery, tools, and other property necessary for the maintenance and working of the joint roads, also all lands and buildings, for whatever purposes used, within or without the location of the roads of each party, and others owned, leased, or operated by them, reserving only to the separate management such other property of each corporation as has been accumulated.\" Art. 2 of Contract. This is a contract \"for the use of their roads;\" and having been neither authorized by the legislature, sanctioned by the railroad commissioners, nor approved by the governor and council, it is illegal.\n\nThe charter bears date June 27, 1835. The corporation is by it\n\"vested with all the powers, privileges, and immunities, which are or may be necessary to carry into effect the purposes and objects of this act as hereinafter set forth, and subject to all the liabilities of corporations of a similar nature.\" \"And the said corporation are hereby authorized and empowered to locate, construct, and finally complete a railroad\" between designated points. Section 2 fixes the capital stock, and then provides that \"the immediate government and direction of the affairs of the said corporation shall be vested in seven directors.\" Article 9 of the contract provides, &#8212; \"The joint roads shall be operated and managed,\" not by the seven directors designated by the charter, but by \"a general manager,\" \"chosen by the concurrent vote of a majority of the directors of each party.\" The Boston  Lowell Railroad directors elect, or help elect, a manager for the Concord Railroad. A manager cannot be elected without their consent. \"And the respective boards of directors shall, by such concurrent action, exercise the same control over the management as is usual with boards of railroad directors in ordinary cases.\" Art. 9. By the charter the Concord Railroad has seven directors charged with the management and direction of its affairs, while by this contract its management and the direction of its affairs are confided to the care and custody of twelve directors. This is a clear violation of the charter.\n\nCan the directors of the Concord Railroad transfer an undivided half of the entire management and \"control\" of its road, \"shops, depots, furniture, rolling stock, machinery, tools, and other property,\" to the directors of the Boston  Lowell Railroad, without the consent of the corporation, the legislature, or governor and council? If they can transfer half, they certainly can the whole. This is what they have done, or attempted to do. It is a complete surrender to the Boston  Lowell directors of one half the control and management of the Concord Railroad. Five men, unknown to the charter, unknown to its stockholders, and unknown to the law of New Hampshire, are now in charge of the Concord Railroad's affairs. It can do nothing unless concurred in by these men. Can the directors of the Concord Railroad, or even the corporation itself; thus transfer their duties under the charter, and divide their responsibilities with others, and absolve themselves from the government and direction of the affairs of the corporation, or any part of them? We maintain they cannot. In Pierce v. Emery,  32 N.H. 504 , C. J. Perley, in speaking of the duty of railroad corporations, said, &#8212; \"They are created to answer a public object, and are bound to the state for the performance of their public duty. They can do no act which would amount to a renunciation of their duty to the public, or which would directly or necessarily disable them from performing it.\" In 2 Potter's Law Corp. 496, it is laid down, &#8212; \"While the law affords railroad corporations adequate and complete protection in the exercise of their\nchartered rights, it also holds them to a strict performance of the duties enjoined upon them, as a consideration for the rights and powers thus granted.\" In Pierce on Railroads 514, it is said, &#8212; \"Corporations having, by reason of their objects, or the extraordinary powers conferred upon them, certain public obligations, are not permitted to enter into contracts which disable them from performing their public functions. Thus, a railroad corporation cannot, as already seen, without legislative authority, transfer by deed, mortgage, lease, or other agreement, its railroad franchises, or assume the ownership or management of some other like enterprise. Such a transfer may have the effect to substitute a scheme differing from that for which authority was obtained, to put the management into the hands of persons other than those intended, and to combine enterprises which the legislature presumably thought it prudent to keep separate.\" In delivering the opinion of the court, in Thomas v. Railroad, 101 U.S. 83 , Judge Miller said, in speaking of a contract like this, &#8212; \"There is another principle, of equal importance and equally conclusive against the validity of this contract, which, if not coming exactly within the doctrine of ultra vires, as we have just discussed it, shows very clearly that the railroad was without power to make such a contract. That principle is, that where a corporation like a railroad company has granted to it by charter a franchise intended in large measure to be exercised for the public good, the due performance of those franchises being the consideration of the public grant, any contract which disables the corporation from performing those franchises, which undertakes without the consent of the state to transfer to others the rights and powers conferred by the charter, and to relieve the grantees of the burden which it imposes, is in violation of the contract with the state, and is void as against public policy.\"\n\nThe transfer, delegation of authority, and alienation of the entire control of the Concord Railroad and its \"shops, depots, furniture, rolling stock, machinery, tools, and other property necessary for the maintenance and working of the\" road, which the contract contemplates, has been accomplished. The contract was on October 11, and is now being performed. \"The immediate government and direction of the affairs of the\" Concord Railroad is not now, and was not when our motion for an injunction was made, on October 11, \"vested in seven directors,\" but is now and was then vested in a \"general manager,\" whose election was dictated by the directors of a foreign corporation, or whose election had to be secured through their concurrence, which practically is the same. The general supervision of this general manager's management of the Concord Railroad and its affairs is not even left to seven directors, but it is by the contract vested in twelve. Under this contract, the employment of agents and servants to operate the Concord Railroad is\nvested as completely in the Boston  Lowell Corporation as it is in the Concord Railroad Corporation. They have the same power to employ and dismiss. The right to the use of every car and engine of the Concord road is as much the privilege of the Boston  Lowell as it is of the Concord. Such a surrender never was or could have been contemplated by the legislature under this charter. If the Concord Railroad can thus surrender and alienate one half of its \"entire control,\" it certainly can the whole. The power authorizing or justifying a transfer of a fractional part will warrant the transfer of the whole.\n\nBy s. 2 of the charter \"the directors shall elect * * a treasurer, who shall give bonds to the corporation * * for the faithful discharge of his trust.\" The by-laws of the corporation, which under the charter it had power to make, prescribe the treasurer's duties in Art. 7. \"It shall be the duty of the treasurer * * safely to keep * * all the moneys, securities, and valuable papers, &#8212; to disburse and deliver over the same as the directors shall require, keep his books and accounts in an approved form, showing the true condition of the finances and funds of the corporation.\" The treasurer is to keep and disburse all moneys. This means, to keep all earnings of the road, and pay cost of running it. Under this contract the earnings of the road do not go to the treasurer elected by the Concord Railroad, as directed by the charter and by-laws, but they go directly into the \"care and custody\" of \"a cashier, who shall be chosen by the concurrent vote of a majority of the directors\" of the Concord road and the directors of the Boston  Lowell road. Art. 10 of Contract. Can the moneys of the Concord Railroad be sent into the hands of such a person, and such a person only, as it is the pleasure of a foreign corporation to designate, and whose election it may dictate? If the Boston  Lowell Corporation can be thus permitted to manage the Concord Railroad and dictate the depository of its earnings, by the same principle the Grand Trunk, New York Central, Pennsylvania Central, either of the Pacific railroads, or a railroad in England, may do it. Such a dictation or management is entirely foreign to anything contemplated or authorized by the charter or laws of New Hampshire. And to tolerate and permit such a course is to admit that the barriers, formerly holding directors and corporations within their chartered sphere and to a strict performance of their corporate duties, have disappeared. With the earnings of the Concord Railroad all in the hands of a \"cashier,\" and mingled with those of the Boston  Lowell Railroad, how is the treasurer, the officer designated by the charter, to show \"the true condition of the finances and funds of the corporation,\" as required by the by-laws? He cannot; and any contract having the effect to disable him from performing his duty is in violation of the charter, and is ultra vires of the corporation and its directors. In speaking of the treasurer's duty and the invalidity of a contract which entrusted another with his duties, Judge Smith, in Pearson v. Tower,, said, &#8212; \"The duties of the treasurer should not be merely nominal. He is required to give bond for the faithful performance of the duties of his office, and he is the proper custodian of the funds of the corporation. * * There is nothing in the language of this by-law that authorizes the directors to make such a disposition of the funds of the corporation as would practically make the duties of the treasurer merely nominal, and relieve him from liability for the safe-keeping of the funds. * * \"The natural and reasonable construction of the language of the statutes, charter, and by-laws of the corporation, requires that the treasurer, in disbursing the funds of the corporation according to the requirement of the directors, should pay them out to satisfy such claims against the corporation as the directors shall authorize; and until the funds be needed for that purpose the treasurer is the only proper officer of the corporation to whom the custody of the funds of the corporation should be entrusted.\" Here is a clear, distinct judicial announcement that no \"cashier\" can be substituted for the treasurer. The treasurer must do his own work. He is the custodian, and the only custodian, of the corporation's funds, who is recognized by the law. In this case a perpetual injunction was granted, and is still in force, enjoining the Concord Railroad from diverting its funds in the manner now attempted and now accomplished. The injunction, even, is disregarded.\n\nBut this is not all the diversion of the funds of the Concord Railroad which is contemplated and accomplished by this contract. First, its earnings must go toward paying the following rentals of roads leased to or controlled by the Boston  Lowell Railroad, viz., &#8212; For the Massachusetts Central Railroad, 25 per cent. of its gross earnings; for Middlesex Central Railroad, $15,000 per year, and 6 per cent. on cost of present extension; for Nashua  Lowell, $65,000 per year; for Wilton Railroad, $14,130 per year; for Peterborough Railroad, 6 per cent. on cost of road, taxes, and $150 per year for organization expenses; for Stony Brook Railroad, 6 per cent. on capital stock, taxes, and $300 per year for organization expenses. Art. 4 of Contract. Where is the authority for taking the earnings of the Concord Railroad for this purpose? Justification for such an assumption of uncertain and extensive obligations on the part of the directors of the Concord Railroad is not to be found in the law of the creation or government of corporations. It is a diversion of the funds of the corporation from the purposes designed and contemplated by the charter, and the contract which attempts it is ultra vires and void. Second, the earnings of the Concord road are to be appropriated to a payment of part of the interest on the cost of the equipment of the Massachusetts Central Railroad, and to contribute toward making good the depreciation of such equipment. Art. 13 of Contract. Third, the earnings of the Concord Railroad under this contract must contribute toward the cost of the insurance of the \"bridges, depots, buildings, wharves,\nfixtures, and other property\" of the Boston  Lowell Railroad, and all such as belong to the roads under its control. Art. 16 of Contract. Fourth, its earnings must contribute toward the payment of interest upon the cost of permanent improvements on the Boston  Lowell road and its leased lines. Art. 17 of Contract. Fifth, its earnings must contribute toward the payment of \"all taxes assessed upon the capital stock\" of the Boston  Lowell road and its branches. Art. 19 of Contract. Sixth, its earnings must contribute toward the \"payment of all expenses incident to the operation of\" the Boston  Lowell and all its leased lines. Art. 21 of Contract. These provisions, we submit, indicate as clear a diversion of the funds of the Concord Railroad as it is possible to state. It may be suggested that the Boston  Lowell Railroad does the same under the contract. That is not an answer. Two wrongs have not yet come to be recognized as an equivalent to one right.\n\nNor does the fact that their design may have been honest, their motives pure and unselfish, and the results of their \"business contract\" beneficial, advantageous, and worthy, save them. These are not elements which either excuse or palliate a violation of the charter or the law, or justify an exercise of authority in excess of that conferred by the charter. As said by Judge Selden, in Bissell v. Railroad,  22 N.Y. 258 , 285 , &#8212; \"The contracts of corporations which are not authorized by their charter are illegal, because they are made in contravention of public policy. * * * Although the unauthorized contract may be neither malum in se nor malum prohibitum, but, on the contrary, may be for some benevolent and worthy object, &#8212; as to build an almshouse or a college, or to purchase and distribute tracts or books of instruction, &#8212; yet if it is in violation of public policy for corporations to exercise powers which have never been granted to them, such contracts, notwithstanding their praiseworthy nature, are illegal and void. * * * The importance of limiting corporate bodies to the exercise of those powers and the enjoyment of those privileges and franchises which have been specifically conferred upon them, must, I think, be obvious. They are rapidly multiplying. Their privileges give them decided advantages over mere private, unincorporated partnerships. They have large capitals and numerous agents, and are capable of entering into combinations with each other. They are not only formidable to individuals, but might even, under some circumstances, become formidable to the state. They are, or should be, created, as we have seen, for public reasons alone; and the legislature is presumed, in every instance, to have carefully considered the public interest, and to have granted just so much power, and so many peculiar privileges, as those interests are supposed to require.\" The legislature of New Hampshire deemed this wholesome principle of the common law of sufficient interest and importance to the people of the state to make it the subject of express enactment. \"Any such corporation may make contracts necessary\nand proper for the transaction of their authorized business, and no other.\" G. L., c. 147, s. 5; &#8212; see, also, s. 6.\n\nSection 5 of the charter provides \"That a toll be and hereby is granted and established for the sole benefit of said corporation, upon all passengers and property of every description which may be conveyed or transported upon said road, at such rates per mile as may be agreed upon and established from time to time by the directors of said corporation.\" This is toll for the sole benefit of the corporation, not for the benefit of the corporation and others. The rate is to be agreed upon and established by the directors of the Concord Railroad, and not by the \"concurrent action\" of the directors of the Concord Railroad and those of another, different, and foreign corporation. How does the contract regulate this? It provides, &#8212; \"No changes in the present local or through rates for transportation shall be made without the approval of the local road so interested, and the joint management.\" Can the directors of the Concord Railroad now agree upon and establish rates \"from time to time\"? That duty, devolving upon them alone under the charter, is, under the contract, to be performed by them in company with \"the joint management,\" without whose consent \"no change\" can be made. Art. 11 of Contract. This is a delegation of their chartered duty, an attempt to divide the responsibility of discharging an obligation imposed by the charter, a partial renunciation of their public trust, and renders them unable to perform their obligations to the state, which were the considerations for the special and extraordinary privileges granted by the charter.\n\nBy section 17 of the charter, the legislature reserved the right, after the expiration of twenty years after the completion of the road, to \"purchase the same of said corporation, and the franchises, rights, and privileges of said corporation, by paying them therefor the amount expended in making said road.\" Can the corporation now sell the road, franchises, rights, and privileges conferred by the charter? Has it not transferred part of its rights and privileges for five years? The contract makes no provision for its termination upon condition that a right to purchase is demanded by the state. This contract creates in this particular another disability of the Concord Railroad to perform its chartered duty.\n\nWhat is this contract? i. e., What is its effect between the parties? What is the legal name for the arrangement to which these parties attempted to bind themselves? Of course we do not forget, in our search for its name, that its draughtsman named it \"a business contract only;\" and then he declares what it shall not be called, viz., \"in no sense as a lease of one road to the other, or as a union of their corporate powers or privileges.\" This, in short, is simply a proclamation of innocence, honesty, and good faith, and that no laws or chartered provisions have been violated. This\ndoes not aid us. It simply confuses, and envelops the matter in greater mystery, and throws suspicion upon its integrity. In Twyne's Case, 3 Co. 80 b., it will be remembered that the honest and apparently innocent declaration \"that the gift was made honestly, truly, and bona fide\" did not save it, but, on the contrary, subjected it to suspicion. When this contract and all its parts are subjected to analysis, the result logically and inevitably reached is, that the arrangement into which these parties have entered is a copartnership. There is not an element wanting. It is full and complete in all its parts. It has the parties, the capital, the business, the profits, and the losses. If \"joint management\" was a visible, tangible, recognizable being, independent of the joint boards of directors, then it would be a lease. But all its parts, when combined, make a much more perfect copartnership. \"Joint management\" means both corporations acting together jointly. This makes the copartnership. Under article 2 of the Contract, both corporations, under the style of \"joint management,\" have \"the entire control of the roads of each party, their shops, depots, furniture, rolling stock, machinery, tools, and other property necessary for the maintenance and working of the joint roads.\" This puts the capital of both together, and makes it one capital under one management, each party enjoying and exercising the same rights in the control and management of the property of the other as in its own. This constitutes the joint capital. All the roads of both parties are managed by one and the same \"general manager,\" who is elected by them jointly. He is the agent and servant of the one party as much as of the other. Art. 9 of Contract. All the earnings of all the roads of both parties go into one pocket indiscriminately. Here exists the unit management, &#8212; the capacity of the same person to bind one party by his act as firmly and irrevocably as he can bind the other, and thereby is created the authority of one to bind the other reciprocally, which is one of the strongest marks of a copartnership. All expenses incurred in running all the roads are deducted from the joint earnings, or the earnings of each, which are commingled in one pocket. Art. 22 of Contract. The expense of running the Boston  Lowell road, or part of it, comes out of the earnings of the Concord road, and vice versa. Liabilities incurred and damages sustained in running over the Boston \nLowell road, or any of its leased lines, must be shared by the Concord road, and vice versa. Art. 8 of Contract. In these elements we find the community of loss complete. \"The net income * * * shall be divided between said corporations in the proportion of 60 per cent. to the Boston  Lowell Railroad, and 40 per cent. to the Concord Railroad.\" Art. 22 of Contract. This is the provision for the community of profits. These elements are all that is required to make a complete partnership.\n\nIn Story on Partnership, s. 2, partnership is defined as \"A contract between two or more persons, by which they join in common\neither their whole substance, or a part of it, or unite in carrying on some commerce, or some work, or some other business, that they may share among them all the profit or loss which they may have by the joint stock which they have put into partnership.\" As defined by Chancellor Kent, &#8212; \"Partnership is a contract of two or more competent persons to place their money, effects, labor, and skill, or some or all of them, in lawful commerce or business, and to divide the profit and bear the loss in certain proportions.\" 3 Kent Com. 23. Where a contract provided that the party of the first part should, in his own name, but in the joint account of himself and the parties of the second part, secure a lease of a railroad, and manage the same at a designated salary for their mutual benefit, the parties of the second part to furnish the necessary money to carry on the enterprise, but to be reimbursed with interest out of the annual profits, and after the payment of such sum, the losses to be borne and the profits to be divided equally between them, it was held to constitute a partnership. Beauregard v. Case,  91 U.S. 134 ; &#8212; see, also, Wills v. Simmonds, 51 How. (N. Y.) Pr. 48; Hills v. Bailey,  27 Vt. 548 ; Somerby v. Buntin,  118 Mass. 279 ; Ward v. Thompson, 22 How. 330; Mumford v. Nicoll, 20 Johns. 611; Gilbank v. Stephenson,  31 Wis. 592 .\n\nAre corporations in the absence of express legislative authority, authorized to engage in copartnership? Is a contract creating a copartnership either in violation of the charter or the statute law of New Hampshire, or is it ultra vires of the corporation or its directors? We maintain the negative of the first, and the affirmative of the second, of these propositions. There is no express warrant for it in the charter. There is no public statute of New Hampshire which in any way warrants or justifies a combination of that character. The public policy of New Hampshire legislation is, and always has been, antagonistic to any and all contracts in any way creating combination, consolidation, or monopoly, without express legislative consent. It has uniformly aimed to compel each corporation to do its own business, perform its own public duties, and keep itself within its corporate province, and not farm them out to others, even though the others may possess the qualities of efficiency, respectability, and responsibility in the superlative degree. The grant was made, and the trust committed to the chartered corporation, and to that only. It is neither allowed to invite others to share with it the powers, privileges, and franchises conferred, nor to grant the request of others to do so. That it was the design of the legislature of New Hampshire, so far as the formation of the public policy on this subject was within its province, to establish one of the character above suggested, is evident from the following statutes: G. L., c. 147, ss. 5, 6; c. 148, s. 3; c. 157, s. 7; c. 158, ss. 11, 12; c. 159, ss. 2, 3, 10; c. 160, ss. 1, 2; c. 164, s. 10. These statutes are designed to restrain corporations within their legitimate limits.\n\nThe principles of the common law are quite as direct and emphatic on this subject. This is manifest from the authorities before cited. Contracts of copartnership have been uniformly held by the courts to be ultra vires. \"Agreements between companies, which create a partnership between the parties thereto, are void.\" Green's Brice's Ultra Vires 423. Corporations at common law have certain powers, but not such as would authorize the forming of a partnership, or the consolidation of two companies into one.\" New York  Sharon Canal Co. v. Bank, 7 Wend. 412. In Whittenton Mills v. Upton, 10 Gray 596, the court, in speaking of a section of the Massachusetts statute identical with the provisions of the following section of our statute, \"The business of every such corporation shall be managed by the directors thereof, subject to the by-laws and votes of the corporation, and, under their direction, by such officers and agents as shall be duly appointed by the directors or by the corporation,\" c. 148, s. 3, said. &#8212; \"It is plain that the provisions of this section cannot be carried into effect where a partnership exists. The partner may manage and conduct the business of the corporation, and bind it by its acts. * * * And the formation of a contract or the entering into a relation by which the corporation or the officers of its appointment should be divested of that power, or by which its franchises should be vested in a partner with equal power to direct and control its business, is entirely inconsistent with that policy. \"The power to form a partnership is not only not among the powers granted expressly or by reasonable implication, but is wholly inconsistent with the scope and tenor of the powers expressly conferred, and the duties expressly imposed, upon a manufacturing corporation under the legislation of the commonwealth.\" See, also, Pearce v. Railroad, 21 How. 441; Marine Bank v. Ogden,  29 Ill. 248 ; Ang.  A. Corp. 248; and authorities previously cited.\n\nIt is entirely immaterial what this contract is named, whether a copartnership, lease, agreement, or \"business contract only.\" The question always returns, and with as much emphasis in the one case as in the other, Is it in accordance with the charter? is it in accordance with the statute law of New Hampshire? or, is it a contract, the execution and performance of which are ultra vires of the directors of the Concord Railroad? \"Corporations may not give up to others their special powers, or the control of their undertakings.\" Green's Brice's Ultra Vires 127, et seq. In Railway v. Railway, 9 Hare 306, it is said, &#8212; \"An agreement between two railway companies, made without the authority of the legislature, whereby one company delegates to another all the powers which have been conferred upon it by parliament, is an unlawful attempt to effect that which parliament alone can authorize, and is against public policy; and in such a case the court will not interfere to assist either of the parties in obtaining a collateral benefit, which the agreement would give, or aid them in any manner which would\npromote the object of the agreement.\" This was an action between the two companies to the agreement. In Winch v. Railway, 13 Eng. L.  E. 507, was involved the validity of a contract, the material part of which is as follows: \"The Birkenhead, Lancashire  Cheshire Junction Railway Company are to give the Associated Companies all the rights, conveniences, and accommodations of their line, stations, offices, sidings, sheds, warehouses, watering-places, c., and are to incur every charge or expense incidental to the use of them, * * excepting only the use of locomotive power, carriages, c., which are to be provided and employed by the associated companies.\" In speaking of this transfer, Sir J. Parker, V. C., said, &#8212; \"Now I think it is impossible that that can be carried out without delegation or transfer to the London  North Western Railway Company of some, at least, of the duties and powers which are given exclusively to the Birkenhead Company by their acts of parliament. * * It seems to me that it is not a question of simple incapacity on the part of the London  North Western Railway Company to undertake the working of this line, but it is against the policy of these acts of parliament; and I think, therefore, that the agreement for making over this property to them is an agreement savoring of illegality, which any shareholder in the Birkenhead Company has a right to come to the court to restrain.\" This was decided in the law court, and reported in 5 De G.  Sm. 562. Beman v. Rufford, 6 Eng. L.  E. 106, was a case involving a similar inquiry. In delivering the opinion, Lord Cranworth, V. C., said, &#8212; \"I will not allow any speculation that it would be more advantageous to do something which the act of parliament does not authorize to be done. * * And * * the contract * * is of itself an illegal contract, and therefore ought not to be carried into effect. And if that be the correct view of the law, I am clearly of opinion, on all the authorities and all principle, that it is the province of this court to prevent such an illegal contract from being carried into effect, because, on the principle so often laid down, this court will not tolerate that parties having the enormous powers which those railway companies have obtained, shall lay out one farthing of the funds out of the way in which it was provided by the legislature that they should be applied.\" This case is also found in 1 Sim. N. S. 550; &#8212; see, also, 10 Beavan 1; 12 Beavan 339. A similar question being under consideration in Gt. Northern R'y v. Eastern Counties R'y, 9 Hare 312, the court said, &#8212; \"The plaintiffs are to manage and regulate the railways of the East Anglican Company for the purposes of the agreement; and, although in form it is declared that the instrument shall not operate as a lease, or agreement for a lease, it amounts, in substance, to either the one or the other. It is framed in total disregard of the obligations and duties which attach upon these companies; and it is an attempt to carry into effect, without the intervention of parliament, what cannot\nlawfully be done except by parliament in the exercise of its discretion with reference to the interests of the public.\"\n\nIn Colman v. Railway, 10 Beavan 15, Lord Langdale said, &#8212; \"It has been very properly admitted, that railway companies have no right to enter into new trades or business not pointed out by the acts; but it has been contended that they have a right to pledge, without limit, the funds of the company in the encouragement of other transactions, however various and extensive, provided the object of that liability is to increase the traffic upon the railway, and thereby to increase the profit to the shareholders. There is, however, no authority for anything of that kind.\" See, as sustaining the same doctrine, East Anglian Railway v. Eastern Counties Railway, 11 C. B. 775. In 8 Ch. App. Cases 679 was a case of the following character: An insurance company was established, with 10 &#163; shares, with the shareholders' liability limited to the amount payable on shares. By its deed of settlement, it was authorized to purchase the business of any other company of a similar nature. Under this authority, the company resolved to purchase the business of a company established with shares of 50 &#163; each. This was held ultra vires, the court saying, &#8212; \"It would require very clear powers to enable a man's partner or partners, or, in a joint stock company, his delegated officers, or the majority of his co-shareholders, to make him a partner with any other person, or a shareholder in any other society. * * But in truth, the more or less similarity of the objects or even absolute identity of the objects, does not affect the principle. It is the entering into a new contract of partnership with new persons, under a new constitution, which is absolutely ultra vires and void unless specially provided for and authorized.\" Railway v. Railway, 11 C. B. 775; MacGregor v. Manager of Railway, 16 Eng. L.  E. 182.\n\nThomas v. Railroad,  101 U.S. 71 , is a recent decision of the supreme court of the United States upon a contract, the essential features of which were like the one at bar. The plaintiffs, on October 8, 1863, entered into an agreement with the Millville  Glassboro' Railroad, a New Jersey corporation, whereby it was stipulated that the company should and did lease to them its road, buildings, and rolling stock for twenty years. There was no special legislative authority for it. In March, 1878, the legislature authorized the consolidation of this company with the West Jersey Railroad Co. The plaintiffs thereupon brought an action for damages they sustained in consequence of the failure of the Millville  Glassboro' Railroad to carry out their contract with them. The circuit court held the contract ultra vires, and that the plaintiffs could not recover upon it. The supreme court affirmed this holding. In delivering the opinion of the court, Judge Miller said, &#8212; \"But while we are satisfied that the contract is both technically and in its essential character a lease, we do not see that the decision\nof that point either way affects the question on which we are to pass. That question is, whether the railroad exceeded its powers in making the contract, by whatever name it may be called. * * * We take the general doctrine to be, in this country, though there may be exceptional cases and some authorities to the contrary, that the powers of corporations organized under legislative statutes are such, and such only, as those statutes confer. Conceding the rule applicable to all statutes, that what is fairly implied is as much granted as what is expressed, it remains that the charter is the measure of its powers, and that the enumeration of its powers implies the exclusion of all others. * * * We have given this case our best consideration, on account of the importance of the principles involved in its decision; and, after a full examination of the authorities, we can see no error in the action of the circuit court.\" The court here also decided that a corporation cannot absolve itself from a discharge of its duties by transferring its powers. Its language on this point we have herein before quoted. See also cases cited by Judge Miller. In Black v. Delaware  Raritan Canal Co[.], 22 N. J. (Eq.) 399, where a like question was raised, discussed, and decided, it was said, &#8212; \"It may be considered as settled that a corporation cannot lease or alien any franchise or any property necessary to perform its obligations and duties to the state without legislative authority. * * * This rule is founded in reason and principle. The franchises granted by the state are often parts of the sovereign power delegated to a subject, and always privileges to which other citizens are not entitled. In these grants the state is supposed to regard the character of the grantee, or the guards and restrictions placed upon the corporation when the grant is by a charter to persons continually changing by transfer of stock. In this case the franchise of maintaining a canal and railroads across public highways and navigable rivers, and of taking tolls and rates of fare fixed by themselves, without control, are with others a material part of the property leased. These cannot be leased or aliened without consent of the state.\" Railroad v. Winans, 17 How. 39. In this case the plaintiff was a Pennsylvania corporation, but its stock was owned by the Baltimore  Susquehanna Railroad; and \"the management of the road is committed to the Maryland company. * * * To preserve appearances with the legislature, an annual statement is made. In this the gross receipts of the entire road for the year are ascertained, and the expenses are deducted. The balance is the dividend, one third being assigned to the plaintiff.\" The plaintiff claimed that this \"agreement to divide the profits did not constitute a partnership, nor evince a relation of principal or agent to impose a liability.\" To this position, Judge Campbell, in delivering the opinion of the court, said, &#8212; \"This conclusion implies that the duties imposed upon the plaintiff by the charter are fulfilled by the construction of the road, and that by alienating\nits right to use, and its powers of control and supervision, it may avoid further responsibility. But those acts involve an overturn of the relations which the charter has arranged between the corporation and the community. Important franchises were conferred upon the corporation to enable it to provide the facilities to communication and intercourse required for the public convenience. Corporate management and control over these were prescribed, and corporate responsibility for their insufficiency provided, as a remuneration to the community for their grant. The corporation cannot absolve itself from the performance of its obligation without the consent of the legislature. * * * It is certainly true that the law will strip a corporation or individual of every disguise, and enforce a responsibility according to the very right, in despite of their artifices. And it is equally certain that, in favor of the right, it will hold them to maintain the truth of the representations to which the public has trusted, and estop them from using their simulation as a covering or defence.\"\n\nIn Pearce v. Madison  Indianapolis Railroad, 21 How. 441, two railroad corporations, chartered by the state of Indiana, were consolidated by agreement, and assumed the name of Madison, Indianapolis  Peru R. R. Co., and under that name, and under a common management, conducted the business of both roads. The head-note is, &#8212; \"Where two separate corporations were created to make railroads, they had no right to unite, and conduct their business under one management; nor had they a right to establish a steamboat line to run in connection with their railroads.\" Judge Campbell, in the court's opinion, says, &#8212; \"There was no authority of law to consolidate these corporations, and to place both under the same management; or to subject the capital of the one to answer for the liabilities of the other.\" In Green's Brice's Ultra Vires, 415, 416, it is laid down, &#8212; \"Contracts between companies which create in fact, if not in name, partnerships, are void, on the double ground of being ultra vires, and also contrary to public policy; and any arrangement for the division of tolls must, it is presumed, be objectionable upon the same grounds.\" See, also, Richardson v. Sibley, 11 Allen 67; Commonwealth v. Smith, 10 Allen 455; Middlesex R. R. v. Boston  Chelsea R. R.,  115 Mass. 351 ; Proprietors v. Railroad,  104 Mass. 1 ; Dam Corp. v. Ropes, 6 Pick. 32; Smith v. Smith, 3 Dessaus. 557; Steamboat Co. v. Dry Dock Co., 26 Am. R. 90; 2 Kent Com. 299; Burritt v. New Haven,  42 Conn. 175 ; Ins. Co. v. Ely,  5 Conn. 572  &#8212; S.C., 2 Cowen 699; Morris Coal Co. v. Barclay Coal Co., 68 Penn. St. 173; State v. Railroad,  29 Conn. 538 ; Com. of T. Co. v. Railroad,  50 Ind. 85 ; Pittsburg \nSteubenville R. R. v. County, 79 Penn. St. 210; Lauman v. Railroad, 30 Penn. St. 42; Troy  Rutland Railroad v. Kerr, 17 Barb. 601; Hoagland v. Railroad,  39 Mo. 451 ; Bank v. Pottery Co.,  34 Vt. 144 . \"Courts should require of the corporation, in all cases, to show plain and clear ground for the\nauthority they assume to exercise.\" Williams v. Davidson,  43 Tex. 2 .\n\nThe reason for limiting corporations to and keeping them within their legitimate province is forcibly stated in 2 Potter's Law Corp., s. 541. \"The number of these bodies increasing daily; the temptations to create them by the advantages of aggregating capital and by the resources of power and patronage they can command, &#8212; they have become a power in the land, controlling its material, commercial, and manufacturing interests, unequalled by any other, often influencing, and sometimes even overshadowing, the power and policy of the government itself. This view of the powers and influence of corporate bodies presents the necessity of the existence in our jurisprudence of the exercise of legal safeguards for the government and the people: this can now be exercised in the administration of the principles of law under that feature of it called ultra vires.\"\n\nW. L. Foster, for the Concord Railroad. The plaintiffs ask for an injunction to restrain the defendants from operating or meddling with the management of the Concord Railroad under the contract of August 19, 1881, between the Boston  Lowell Railroad Corporation and the Concord Railroad Corporation, providing for a \"more economical joint operation and management of the said roads.\" The claim of the plaintiffs is, that the injunction should be granted without proof of their charges of fraudulent conspiracy; without proof of any actual damage done or likely to be done to their interests; before the legal rights of the parties are settled by a decision of the court on the merits; before any facts are shown which would be material to be considered on any question of law, and without inquiry into any other matters than the conceded facts that the plaintiffs are stockholders of the Concord Railroad; that such a contract has been made, and that the contracting parties have entered upon its performance in accordance with its terms, &#8212; contending that the contract was beyond the corporate powers of the Concord Railroad, and would be invalid even if made in good faith, and if beneficial to the plaintiffs. The proposition is, to exclude all evidence which may tend to explain the nature, meaning, intent, and purposes of the contract and its practical operation, and to procure a decree that it is void, merely upon the assertion of the plaintiffs that an inspection of the document discloses that it is \"in violation of the public law of New Hampshire and the charter and by-laws of the corporation.\"\n\nWithout stopping to refute by argument the extraordinary suggestion that the court proceed to consider the question of the validity of this contract before any evidence is offered tending to show that the interests of the plaintiffs are endangered, and without entering upon the consideration of the wholesale charges of corruption, fraud, and unlawful conspiracy, we propose to submit certain\nlegal considerations lying at the foundation of this investigation (broad and general as it must be, and not restricted as the plaintiffs insist), which seem to deserve primary attention. It is true, as the plaintiffs allege, that \"the railroad of the Concord Railroad Corporation is thirty-five miles in length, and for a long time has been, and still is, and of necessity must continue to be, a necessary and natural outlet for the traffic of the said Northern and Boston, Concord  Montreal railroads.\" In other words, it is true that the Concord Railroad, the Nashua  Lowell Railroad, and the Boston  Lowell Railroad are parts of a connected line and route of transportation extending from Massachusetts, through New Hampshire, to Vermont and the Western States. The purpose of these roads and their connections is to provide for, promote, and facilitate the transportation of freight and passengers in the way and by the means best calculated to promote the advantage not only of the stockholders of the respective corporations, but of the public; and such, the defendants are prepared to show, is the object, and such will be the effect, of this contract.\n\nThe contract is said to be \"in direct violation of the public law of New Hampshire:\" \"No sale, lease, mortgage, or contract for the use of any railroad shall be valid unless it shall be in writing, filed in the office of the secretary of state, and authorized by the legislature.\" G. L., c. 159, s. 2. \"No contract between two or more railroad corporations for the use of their roads shall be legal or binding for a longer period than five years, nor unless sanctioned in writing by the railroad commissioners, and approved by the governor and council.\" G. L., c. 164, s. 10. The defendants insist, and their answers and evidence will show (would have shown before this time, if the plaintiffs had not by their objections placed obstructions in the way and progress of the case, to the unnecessary delay of its final determination), that the contract is not in violation of any law of the state or the charter of the Concord Railroad. The defendants are charged with fraud and unlawful conspiracy, and their contract is pronounced illegal. The plaintiffs ask the court to read the contract, take judicial notice of the law, and pass judgment against the accused without further evidence. The court will not require us to accept this situation. The accusations of the plaintiffs, in the absence of proof on their part, are confronted by the presumption of the legality of the contract. The plaintiffs have the burden of proof, and no amount of extravagant assumptions and assertions will sustain it. The ordinary rules of the construction of contracts apply to this instrument, namely, &#8212;\n\n1. It must be reasonably construed, according to the intention of the parties.\n\n2. The construction should be liberal.\n\n3. And favorable, so that the agreement, if possible, be supported.\n\n4. The popular meaning of words is to be adopted.\n\n5. The whole contract is to be considered, and its subject-matter, in construing particular terms, which are to be understood in the sense most agreeable to the nature of it.\n\n6. Although the construction and interpretation is for the court, parol and extrinsic evidence is admissible to aid that construction and interpretation. \"Some evidence from without must be admissible in the explanation or interpretation of every contract.\" 2 Pars. Cont. 547, 549; Metc. Cont. 272, 277, 278, 285, 287, 303; Pott. Dwarris 177; Leake Cont. 119.\n\n7. The contracts of a corporation are presumed to be infra vires. Southern Express Co. v. Western N.C. R. R.,  99 U.S. 191 .\n\nThe burden of showing the incapacity of the corporations to make the contract is on the party denying its validity. And the inquiry is, not whether the contract was authorized, but whether it was forbidden. Whatever is not prohibited is permitted. Taylor v. Chichester  M. R'y, L. R. 2 Ex. 356, 462, 384. \"There can be no doubt that a corporation is fully capable of binding itself by any contract except where the statutes by which it is created or regulated expressly, or by necessary implication, prohibit such contract. Prima facie, all its contracts are valid, and it lies on those who impeach any contract to make out that it is avoided. This is the doctrine of ultra vires, and is, no doubt, sound law.\" Parke, B., in Scottish N.E. R'y v. Stewart, 3 Macq. 382, 415; Taylor v. Chichester  M. R'y, supra; Brice's Ultra Vires 38-40; Green's Brice's Ultra Vires 37-40 and notes. Corporations have an implied power to make such contracts as are usual and necessary for carrying into effect the purposes for which they are created. Ang.  A. Corp., s. 271. A railroad corporation is sometimes authorized to make contracts by an express provision of statute; but in the absence of such a provision the power is implied as necessary and incidental to the express power to locate, construct, maintain, and work a railroad. The power, whether express or implied, must, in view of the purposes and methods of such an enterprise, be allowed a liberal scope. South Wales Railway v. Redmond, 10 C. B. N. S. 675, 685. \"The company, by custom and necessity, conducts operations which are extensive and miscellaneous. It holds wide relations with local and general business. It is generally designed, not merely to convey passengers and goods upon its own road, but to be a part of an extended line of transportation. Its capacity to make contracts cannot, therefore, be measured by the narrow and rigid rules which were applied in an early day to business or commercial corporations.\" Its power, in respect to contracts and business dealings, extends not merely to those which are absolutely essential or indispensable to the performance of the specified acts authorized by its charter, but as well to those which, not being prohibited by statute or public policy, are designed and may be\nuseful to promote the main enterprise. It may enter into such contracts and transactions, incidental or auxiliary to its main business, as may become necessary, expedient, or profitable in the care and management of the property which it is authorized to control and manage under its charter. Brown v. Winnisimmet Co., 11 Allen 326, 334; Smith v. N.  L. R. R., 27 N.H. 86 ,  94 ; Pierce Railroads 499, 501, and cases cited. \"It must be borne in mind that the courts in recent times have been extremely liberal in the construction of powers of railroad corporations to accomplish the general scope and objects of their creation, and that the question of ultra vires has not been of late years construed with the strictness that existed in former times.\" By the legislation of many states, general authority is given for the sale, lease, or consolidation of railroad corporations; and in others, where such authority is not in terms conferred great encouragement has been given to the union of lines of railroad for the purpose of having them operated under some general management. Dimpfel v. Ohio  Miss. R'y, 9 Biss. 127. Great liberality in this direction characterizes the legislation of parliament, and the construction thereof by the English courts. \"Railway Clauses Consolidation Act\" (1845), 8 Vict., c. 20; S. Yorkshire R'y  River Dun Co. v. Gt. Northern R'y, 3 DeG. McN. \nG. 576; Browne  Theobald Railway Companies 293; Green's Brice's Ultra Vires (2 ed.) 421. \"A corporation, owning and operating a railroad making a continuous line with that of another corporation, may, it seems, irrespective of any special provision of its charter, lawfully contract with the latter company for the joint purchase and ownership of locomotives to be used on both roads. If otherwise, the power is implied in a legislative provision for the connection of the first railroad with a point at the further end of the second, `by railroad, canal, or slack-water navigation.'\" Olcott v. Tioga R. R.,  27 N.Y. 546 ,  560 .\n\nIf railroad corporations may thus contract for the ownership and use of locomotives, where is the limitation with regard to property? Upon the general subject of the powers of railroad corporations in respect to mutual contracts, reference may be had to Green's Brice's Ultra Vires 409-426 and notes. The principle, clearly established on both sides of the Atlantic, is, that the powers of railroad corporations to contract with each other for transportation upon and the general management of connecting roads, are, and from the demands and necessities of business must be, allowed all the freedom consistent with public policy as declared by law.\n\nThere is a wide distinction between the condition of these contracting parties, and the circumstances contemplated by the provisions of Gen. Laws, c. 158, ss. 11-13. Neither of the contracting parties, nor the northern roads with which they connect, are parts, of rival or competing lines, and as such open to the objections considered in Currier v. Concord R. R., 48 N.H. 321 ,  325 , and Morrill v. B.  M. R. R.,  55 N.H. 531 .\nAnd the provisions of Gen. Laws, c. 158, s. 11, requiring the sanction of the legislature and the approval of the governor and council for the validity of a contract for the consolidation of rival or competing lines, have no application; because, by s. 13 of the same chapter, the prohibition of the law is declared not to apply to \"contracts or leases for the running and operation of any road constructed as an extension or continuation of a separate and independent line, or as parts and parcels of the same, or to any side branches tributary or secondary to such line, all which are specially exempted from the provisions of\" the prohibitions contained in s. 11.\n\nThe contract is in no sense an arrangement for consolidation. Consolidation is the American term which takes the place of the English word \"amalgamation,\" which means the sale or transfer of the assets of one company to another, and the commutation of the shares of one company into those of another, whereby membership in the new company is substituted for membership in the old; though it is said the term \"amalgamation,\" as commonly used in English law, has a wider meaning than consolidation has with us. But the American use of the word implies the dissolution of two or more corporations and the creation of a new corporation, with stockholders, property, and liabilities derived from the corporations passing out of existence. Green's Brice's Ultra Vires 631; McMahan v. Morrison, 16 Ind. 172 ; State v. Bailey,  16 Ind. 46 ; Shields v. Ohio,  95 U.S. 319 . Any other use of the term is meaningless and inconsiderate, though doubtless common enough, and is thoughtlessly regarded as comprehending all sorts of mischief. By the terms of the contract the idea of amalgamation, consolidation, or partnership is expressly repudiated, and the agreement is declared to be in no sense a lease, or a union of corporate powers or privileges; but each party retains to itself all its chartered rights and liabilities. Art. 1. These terms are not mere figures of speech, but are expressions of the understanding and intention of the contracting parties; and while it is true the nature of things is not changed by the application of definitions, parties may and do bind and estop themselves by a declaration of their assumed powers and purposes. The contract, therefore, is not within the terms or intendment of Gen. Laws, c. 158, s. 11.\n\nNeither is it within the provisions of Gen. Laws, c. 159, s. 2, or c. 164, s. 10. It is not a sale (which requires a vendor and a purchaser, and a consideration of price paid), nor a lease (which requires a lessor and a lessee, and a stipulated rental), nor a mortgage (which requires a mortgagor and a mortgagee, and a condition), nor a contract for the use of a railroad (which contemplates the surrender, to a greater or less extent, of the control of one road to that of another), but it is precisely, and in good faith, what it purports to be, &#8212; a \"business contract only,\" the result of \"a joint business, passing over the roads and through the hands of both parties, making desirable a common policy and unanimity of\nmanagement.\" Its object is the promotion of the mutual interest of the parties \"through a more efficient and more economical joint operation and management of said roads, and for the better security of their respective investments, as well as for the convenience and interest of the public.\" That it is in fact what it is declared to be we expect to demonstrate by the evidence which the plaintiffs desire to exclude. If the nature, purpose, and scope of the agreement are such as is thus declared by the contracting parties, their contract is not repugnant to the provisions of any \"public law\" of the state, nor (as we shall presently discover) to the limitations of the charter of the Concord Railroad.\n\nContracts relating to traffic between connecting roads, the manner of conducting it, and the division of the profits, \"when made with a bona fide purpose to regulate traffic in a reasonable and just manner, are generally held good.\" The division of the tolls and fares, in such a case, may be according to any plan which is agreed upon, and need not be based upon the relative distances traversed by connecting roads. The receipts may be divided by an arbitrary schedule fixed upon, not always, or in most cases, giving to each line the share earned on it, and that only. \"In many cases there may be good reasons for making a difference in the division of the profits. If an advantageous arrangement can be made by a line at the south end of a route with a line at the north end, for carrying passengers in common, which could not profitably (and therefore would not) be entered into by the north line unless it received a larger proportion of the earnings than in proportion to its work, there is no reason or principle of law why the south line should be prohibited from making an arrangement profitable to its stockholders, on the ground that the division of the earnings must be unequal. The directors of such companies have the right to make contracts as to carrying passengers and freight. Such contracts, when made in good faith and for the supposed advantage of the business and of the stockholders, are reasonable, politic, and lawful. The expediency of making them must depend on the judgment of some one, and in all railroad corporations the management of all the concerns is committed to the directors. The want of the power to make such contracts would be a great injury to most railway corporations, as well as to the public, who (as will be shown in this case) are much benefited by the arrangement. Stewart v. E. W. Trans. Co.,  17 Minn. 372 ; Sussex R. R. v. Morris  Essex R. R., 19 N. J. (Eq.) 13 &#8212; S.C., 20 id. 542; Green's Brice's Ultra Vires 415, 416, note. It is held in England that agreements providing for the division of profits arising from the whole existing traffic of a line in proportions calculated on the past course of traffic are not ultra vires or otherwise void. South Yorkshire R'y  River Dun Co. v. Gt. Northern R'y, 9 Ex. 55. But the plaintiffs, by their bill, make no complaint about the division of the net income of the traffic. If they shall hereafter specify\nan objection of this character, we shall be prepared to meet it, and to show, among other things in that connection, that the method of division ensures to the Concord Railroad a proportion of the net income fully as large as has heretofore accrued to them under previously existing arrangements.\n\nWe are not called upon at present to consider in detail all the provisions of this contract. If in any specific part it shall ultimately be held illegal or invalid, such part may be rejected or modified. It is sufficient for the present inquiry to meet and answer any evidence tending to show that the general scope of the contract is not contrary to the provisions of any law of the state. The only evidence presented by the plaintiffs is the contract itself. Until we shall have had an opportunity to present the testimony essential to the fair interpretation and understanding of the contract in respect to its practical operation, we can only consider briefly, and in a general way, the specified objections named in the\n\nThe charges, that the defendant directors (or some of them) have but little personal pecuniary interest in the stock or successful operation of the Concord Railroad; that they have large interests in rival roads; that the corporations designated as rival and competing are such in fact; that the directors of the Concord Railroad were elected on account of their interest in and partiality to other and rival roads; that the provisions of the contract are injurious to the interests and destructive of the rights and property of the Concord Railroad and its stockholders; and the general and indefinite charges of fraud and conspiracy, &#8212; are not, we submit, sustained by mere inspection of the contract, but are subjects of proof, the burden of which rests on the complainants. When the defendants are called upon to answer the bill, each and all of these charges will be unqualifiedly denied.\n\nThe first complaint worthy of present attention is that which relates to Articles II and IX of the contract, which are said to provide for a delegation of authority not recognized or authorized by the charter of the Concord Railroad. The charter (Private Acts of 1835, c. 1), in its second section, provides that \"the immediate government and direction of the affairs of said corporation shall be vested in seven directors\" &#8212; a provision not peculiar, but common to all corporate grants. Article IX of the contract provides that \"the joint roads shall be operated by a general manager, who shall be chosen by the concurrent vote of a majority of the directors of each party, and may be removed in like manner, or by the unanimous vote of either board; and the respective boards of directors shall, by such concurrent action, exercise the same control over the management as is usual with boards of railroad directors in ordinary cases.\" It is claimed that this is a delegation of the authority of the directors to an authority (the general manager) selected by a foreign corporation. It is manifest that all the practical management,\nin detail, of the business of a railroad is, and of necessity must be, in a certain sense, delegated by the directors, who exercise only a general government and direction over the affairs of the corporations. Directors of a railroad corporation never did and never can personally manage and operate the running of a railroad. Invariably and of necessity they act through agents; and the agency, comprehending the immediate control of the \"shops, depots, furniture, rolling-stock, machinery, tools,\" c., is always vested in a superintendent or manager, and his sub-agents. Can there be any doubt that the directors of two connecting railroads may both appoint the same person as superintendent or manager? Where is the provision of law, or public policy, or good management, which forbids such an appointment?\n\nThere is no legal or reasonable objection to two or more connecting railroads having one or more common directors. There are probably few extended lines of connecting railroads in the country where such representation does not exist. They are found in most of the New England states as well as the larger states of the West. I am not aware that the legal validity of such conditions has ever been denied; and such conditions and such an arrangement, assuming the honesty and capacity of the directors, seem for obvious reasons desirable. In such cases, the directors themselves of one road may be said to exercise immediate control of the management of another road.\n\nIf the directors of either company may delegate the management of the practical running of the road to an agent, by whatever name, \"manager\" or other, he may be called, and two boards of directors may appoint the same person as manager, it would seem they may do it by concurrent vote, not of a majority of one board acting with a minority of the other board, but by the votes of a majority of each board; and that the manager may be removed in like manner. In such case, the manager is appointed by each board. The Boston  Lowell corporation cannot appoint a manager of the Concord Railroad without the consent and the action of the appointing power conferred upon the directors of the Concord corporation. Neither board delegates the power of appointment to the other. The manager may be removed by the unanimous vote of either board; that is to say, the board of directors of each road, with whom the power of appointment and removal is invested, have, in the exercise of their authority to manage the concerns of their own road, agreed that they will not retain a general manager who shall be obnoxious to the other contracting party. If two or more connecting railroad corporations may jointly own and possess locomotives and other property, and jointly use the same on their common route (as we have seen they may), why may they not jointly employ the agents controlling and managing that property? We fail to discover in this arrangement any illegal delegation of directory power.\n\nThe cashier is appointed and may be removed in the same way. But, concerning the character and effect of the provisions of the contract relating to the cashier, it will appear, when the evidence is submitted, that the plaintiffs' \"information and belief,\" and their fearful apprehensions, are wholly without any foundation in fact. The plaintiffs charge that the defendants \"have transferred and are transferring all the moneys and earnings of the Concord Railroad from the hands and possession of the treasurer, agents, servants, and employes of said Concord Railroad to the possession and custody and into the control of said cashier,\" etc. But it will be shown that exactly the reverse of this is being done. It is manifest that no treasurer of a railroad corporation ever does or can receive immediately the moneys of the corporation. These all come, in the natural course of business, first into and then through the hands of various subordinate officers, &#8212; conductors, ticket-sellers, and various other officers, &#8212; into the custody of the treasurer. The office of treasurer is by no means dispensed with, nor are his powers, duties, or responsibilities abridged or curtailed in any way by or through the intermediate agency of the cashier. The care and custody of the finances of the joint management are, by the terms of Art. X of the contract, confided to a cashier for temporary purposes only, just as the care and custody of the finances of the Concord Railroad have always been confided to the cashier of the Concord Railroad for temporary purposes only, &#8212; with the difference, that under the present management the penal sum of the cashier's bond (formerly $15,000) has been raised to $30,000. The bond required is \"such suitable bond for the performance of his trust as may be prescribed by the directors of each corporation;\" and, in compliance with such requirement, the present cashier has given to the Concord Railroad his bond in the sum of $30,000, with abundantly sufficient sureties, approved by the directors of the Concord Railroad, which bond is lodged with the general manager, himself a director of the Concord road. The cashier's temporary custody of the finances of the corporation, in compliance with the terms of Art. XXIV, is transferred to the treasurer of the respective corporations at the close of each month.\n\nBy Art. XI it is provided that no changes in the local or through rates for transportation shall be made without the approval of the directors of the local road so interested and the joint management. The complaint in this particular is, that a foreign corporation may interfere in the regulation of the local and through freights in which, on account of the business connection of the roads, such foreign corporation, one of the contracting parties, is interested. But such regulations, by mutual agreement, have always been made and must necessarily exist in every case in which two or more connecting roads conduct the business of through transportation; and the validity and the reasonableness of such arrangements have never been doubted. Unless the local and through rates are arranged\nby mutual agreement, and remain thus fixed until changed by mutual consent, disastrous competitions and collisions will ensue For example: If the price of a passenger ticket from Concord to Boston has been established by the three connecting roads forming the line between those two places, at $1.00 from Concord to Nashua, + 50 cents from Nashua to Lowell, + 50 cents from Lowell to Boston, = $2.00, it would not be fair for the Boston  Lowell Railroad, without the consent of the Concord Railroad, to agree to carry passengers from Lowell to Boston for 25 cents, or to raise the local fare to 75 cents. If the Boston  Lowell road should do this, the Concord road must necessarily reduce or raise the price of a through ticket accordingly; otherwise, in case of the reduction by the Boston  Lowell road, the through passenger would buy a ticket only to Lowell, and the Concord road would lose its just proportion of the profit of carrying the passenger from Lowell to Boston. But it is sufficient to say that the directors, to whom the general control of the affairs of the corporation is entrusted, have the power, acting honestly and for the supposed advantage of their own road, to agree with another road as to what the rates of transportation shall be, and whether or not, and to what extent, if any, they shall be increased or diminished. By such arrangement neither party parts with its corporate power Columbus c. R. R. v. Indianapolis c. R. R., 5 McLean 450, 454.\n\nComplaint is made with regard to the method agreed upon for the settlement, by arbitration, of matters of disagreement arising under the contract. That directors of corporations may refer all disputes and controversies to arbitration, and to such arbitrators as may be agreed upon, in good faith, will not be denied. Morse on Arb. 5. The charge that Mr. Haves is not an impartial arbitrator is a charge that requires proof; that he has merely a nominal interest in the Concord Railroad, that he has large interests, or any interests whatever, as stockholder, creditor or debtor, in the Boston  Lowell Railroad or in any rival roads, whose interests are adverse to the Concord Railroad; is also a matter of proof; but the charge is denied, and the fact is the reverse of the plaintiffs' assertion. The objections suggested to Art. VI are all based upon the unwarranted assumption not only that the directors of the Concord Railroad are \"interested adversely\" to the corporation and its stockholders, but also that they are dishonest and corrupt. The court will require proof of these charges, and substantial evidence that the fears of the plaintiffs are not groundless. The leases and contracts indicated by the terms of this article must, of course, be legal leases and contracts; and the provision, that no such lease or contract shall be made as shall reduce the joint income of the contracting parties without the sanction of the board of directors of each party, would seem to afford reasonable security to the interests of the stockholders of the Concord Railroad. The same considerations apply to all the suggestions of\npossible detriment to the plaintiffs, through improvident, injudicious, or fraudulent management, including the matter of the rental of the Massachusetts Central Railroad. The directors of these several connecting roads are entrusted by law with the management and \"direction of the affairs\" thereof. If their management shall be deemed by the stockholders improvident or injudicious, the stockholders will apply the remedy. If their contracts are invalid, they will be so declared. If themselves are dishonest, corrupt, or fraudulent, the law will control and punish them.\n\nIn general terms, the charge is preferred that this contract provides for the surrender of the control of the Concord Railroad to the Boston  Lowell Railroad; that it provides for the use of the former road by the latter corporation. If under the provisions of this contract the surrender of the use of one road is made to the corporation of the other road, which is the road surrendered to the other? This suggestion has been incidentally and sufficiently referred to in the preceding discussion. But what is really the relative position of these corporations and their roads and business? The Boston  Lowell and the Concord railroads are parts of a continuous connecting line, extending from Boston, through New Hampshire, to Vermont and the West. The local business of the roads (by which is meant the business originating and terminating in the same state and upon one road) is very small in amount as compared with the through business of the line, the business originating in one state and terminating in another. For example, it will be shown that the amount of through and local freight tonnage on the Concord Railroad for five years ending March 31, 1881, was as follows:\n\nThe Concord road carried to and received from the lower roads,                                730,682,944 lbs. The Concord road carried to and received from the upper roads,                                510,783,878 lbs. The lower roads carried to and received from the upper roads,                              4,380,630,604 lbs. --------------- Total,                                 5,622,097,426 lbs.\n\nThe local tonnage upon the Concord road was 440,090,224 lbs. The through tonnage was about 92 3/4 per cent., and the local tonnage about 7 1/4 per cent., of the whole freight business. The local business, important in itself and with respect to local customers of the road, is but an incident to the main business of the line; but it is necessarily, in the management of the trains, cars, and servants of the road, so intermixed with the through business, that any arrangement contemplating the through business must, of necessity, carry with it and include an arrangement for the local business, both classes of business being transacted upon the same trains, and by means of the same employes and agents. No two\nconnecting roads can be conveniently, economically, or successfully managed, either in the interest of the corporations or of the public, without the common use of the property of the connecting roads. Every time a car runs from one road to another, or a brakeman or conductor runs from one road to another, these cars and agents are necessarily employed for the common benefit of the connecting roads; and if the law prohibited the running of the cars of one road from that road to and over another road, the transfer of passengers and freight at the terminal connection of the two roads would necessarily involve, to a great extent, the common use of the property of the two roads. From the earliest institution of railroads the cars of connecting roads have been run, those of each over the road of the other, for the convenience of the public as well as of the corporations, in order to save the trouble, delay, and expense of the transfer of passengers and freight. It is obvious that any other mode of operation would involve great expense and inconvenience. The question, therefore, seems to be, not whether there may be a common use, but what shall be the extent of that common use.\n\nSince the earliest introduction of railway traffic into the state, contracts have been habitually made whereby the cars and servants of one corporation have been run over the railroad of another[.] No instance can be found in which such contracts have been submitted to the approval of the governor and council or the railroad commissioners, and no suggestion has heretofore been made that such contracts required such approval. But if the construction claimed by the plaintiffs be correct, no one among the hundreds of contracts providing for connecting business between railroads has been executed in this state since 1850 (Laws of 1850, c. 953, s. 8), without a violation of our state law.\n\nThe statute of 1855 sanctioned and required the common use, by two connecting roads, of the cars and passengers of each, and did not prohibit, but, on the contrary, by plain intendment, authorized, a contract between connecting roads, by which the one road should use the other as well with its locomotives and servants as with its engines and cars. Laws of 1855, c. 1666, s. 2. This provision of law has been reenacted, and is still in force. G. L., c. 164, ss. 1, 2. The germ of this statute is found in Rev. Sts., c. 142, 8. 10, concerning contracts between railroads for doing connecting business, and concerning the terms of connection. The law of 1850, above cited, did not repeal the foregoing provision of the Revised Statutes, but had reference to a different class of contracts. This is indicated by Laws of 1851, c. 1113, entitled \"An act to provide a mode of adjustment of the terms of connection between railroads,\" which provided, not that the contract between the roads be submitted to the governor and council, the railroad commissioners, or the legislature, but \"that in all cases where railroads are unable to agree upon terms of connection, or on referees\nto whom the same be submitted,\" either road may apply to the court for the appointment of referees \"to adjust and determine all matters of connection between the parties for such term as said referees may award, not exceeding one year, or such further time as the parties may agree upon.\" This act was repealed in 1855 by the statute before cited (Laws, c. 1666), entitled \"An act relating to the connection of railroads,\" the latter act also containing a similar provision with regard to the submission to referees of questions concerning the terms of connection and matters of disagreement, such referees to be appointed in the same manner as provided by the act of 1851. By the act of 1856 (Laws, c. 1847), the act of 1855 is applied \"to all railroads chartered by the legislature of this state which connect with any other railroad chartered by the legislature of this state, or by the concurrent action of the legislature of this state and any other state or states, notwithstanding neither of said connecting roads are by law authorized to unite with or enter upon and use the other.\"\n\nGen. Laws, c. 164 (except the last section, which has reference to a contract of a different character from that contemplated by the previous sections), is substantially a reenactment of the acts of 1855 and 1856, as indicated by the marginal references; and this law (c. 164, ss. 1, 9), now in force, contemplates no action by the legislature, or the governor and council, or railroad commissioners, but provides for a reference (in case the parties are unable to agree), as in the preceding laws on the same subject. The marginal references to Gen. Laws, c. 164, s. 10, are incorrect, through a mistake of the printer or the compilers. \"R. S. 146:10 \" should be R. S. 142:10; and \"1853, 953:8\" should be 1850, 953:8. The use contemplated by Gen. Laws, c. 164, s. 10, is not an arrangement of the character provided for by the contract under consideration, but is such a use as involves the surrender, to a greater or less extent, of the control of its railroad by one corporation to another. A use that is made of one road by the cars and locomotives of another corporation, under the control of the officers and agents of the road thus used for the convenience of the connecting business, is not a use forbidden by statutes. But the use contemplated by the last named statute is where one railroad is used by another corporation, subject to the control of the user, &#8212; like the common use, for example, of the Essex Railroad, between Peabody and Salem, Mass., by the Boston  Lowell and the Eastern railroads, for their separate convenience and necessities. If contracts like that under consideration, relating to the connecting business between railroads, had been intended by the statute last referred to, such intention would have been expressed in terms so plain as not to have required the experience of forty years to discover the prohibition of the law.\n\nHere is a contract which, in effect, provides that the same person shall be the general manager of each of the connecting roads.\nHis management, with reference to the control of either road, is management with which he is entrusted by the directors of the corporation controlling that road, and is the management of the directors of that road by their lawfully appointed agent. Here is a contract providing for the common use of property of connecting roads, in the interests of convenience, efficiency, economy, and the public good. It may be said, the common use of the separate property of the roads is more extensive than has heretofore been exercised; but if contracts may be made, such as have heretofore always been regarded as lawful, concerning the use of the cars of one corporation by another, if connecting railroads may lawfully contract with each other for the joint purchase and ownership of locomotives to be used on both roads (Olcott v. Tioga R. R., supra), upon what principle of law or logic shall a similar use of other property essential to the advantageous operation of the through business, and the employment, by mutual agreement, of the same agents and servants, such as brakemen, conductors, c., by both parties, be excluded? And why may not such an arrangement be made, in good faith and in the exercise of the discretionary power vested in the contracting boards of directors, with regard to the local traffic, necessarily managed in connection with the through traffic, as shall seem to be for the best interests of all concerned therein?\n\nWith one other suggestion, this branch of the discussion, in many respects, no doubt, premature, is suspended. Considering the obvious impossibility, by reason of the mixed nature of the traffic, of making other than an arbitrary, approximate separation of the expense of the local from that of the through business, it would seem that an arrangement providing for a division of the joint income of the whole traffic, by an agreed percentage, determined with reference to the results of the previous mutual dealings of the parties, and established by the consenting judgment and discretion of those having charge, by law, of the prudential affairs of the contracting corporations (a judgment and discretion exercised with a view to the interests of all the stockholders and of the public &#8212; interests necessarily combined, and in a large degree identical), is no more objectionable than the conceded validity of an arrangement by which one corporation shall pay to the other a given sum for doing the connecting business of its road. We contend, therefore, that the provisions of Gen. Laws, c. 159, s. 2, and c. 164, s. 10, have no relation to this contract.\n\nIf applicable at all, they cannot be applied to a contract of this nature, between corporations, parts of a continuous line of through transportation, extending from one state into another. If thus applied, the statutes themselves are invalid, so far as they relate to or affect a railroad connected in a continuous line with a railroad in another state, because they are repugnant to the constitution and laws of the United States. \"This constitution and the laws\nof the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof * * * shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges of every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.\" U.S. Const., Art. VI. The federal constitution is of complete obligation, and binds state sovereignties. The laws of congress made in pursuance thereof suspend or overrule all state laws with which they are in conflict, and the latter are void and nugatory so far as the supreme law extends. The nullity of any act inconsistent with the federal constitution and laws is produced by the declaration that the constitution is the supreme law. The state laws are annihilated, so far as the ground upon which they stand is occupied by the laws of the Union. M'Culloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316; Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1; N. R. Steamboat Co. v. Livingston, 3 Cow. 713, 716; Metropolitan Bank v. Van Dyck,  27 N.Y. 400 ,  469 ; Pierce v. The State,  13 N.H. 536 ,  553 . By the federal constitution, power is conferred upon congress \"to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes.\" U.S. Const., Art. 1, s. 8. Chief-Justice Marshall, in the historical case which embodies an exposition of this clause of the constitution, has adopted a definition of the term \"commerce,\" as used in that instrument, which for nearly three quarters of a century has been regarded as settled. \"Commerce, as the word is used in the constitution, is a unit, every part of which is indicated by the term.\" Gibbons v. Ogden, supra; Lin Sing v. Washburn,  20 Cal. 534 . It is not limited to traffic, to buying and selling, or to the interchange of commodities, but \"all America understands and has uniformly understood the word `commerce' to comprehend navigation. It was so understood when the constitution was framed. The power over commerce, including navigation, was one of the primary objects for which the people of America adopted the government, and must have been contemplated in forming it. The convention must have used the word in that sense, because all have understood it in that sense, and the attempt to restrict it comes too late.\" Gibbons v. Ogden, supra. Commerce is intercourse as well as traffic, commercial intercourse between nations and parts of nations. Gibbons v. Ogden, supra; United States v. Bailey, 1 McLean 234; The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557; M'Culloch v. Maryland, supra; Groves v. Slaughter, 15 Pet. 449; Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419; United States v. Holliday, 3 Wall. 407: Mitchell v. Steelman,  8 Cal. 363 ; People v. Brooks, 4 Den. 469, 476; N. R. Steamboat Co. v. Livingston, supra; Moor v. Veazie,  32 Me. 343 ,  863-365 ; Corfield v. Coryell, 4 Wn. C. C. 371; State v. Delaware c. R. R., 30 N. J. (Law) 473; State Freight Tax Cases, 15 Wall. 275; The Clinton Bridge, 10 Wall. 454.\n\nThe power conferred upon congress is to regulate commerce \"among the several states.\" \"A thing which is among others is intermingled with them. Commerce among the states cannot stop\nat the external boundary line of each state, but may be introduced into the interior.\" The states of the federal union either join each other, in which case they are separated by a mathematical line, or they are remote from each other, in which case other states lie between them. Trading intercourse among the states must commence in one state and terminate in another, and the power of congress must therefore be exercised within the territorial jurisdiction of the several states. What is this power? It is the power to regulate, that is, to prescribe, the rules by which commerce is governed. This power, like all others vested in congress, is complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations other than are prescribed in the constitution. It comprehends navigation and other means of commercial intercourse within the limits of every state in the Union, so far as those means of intercourse may be in any manner connected with commerce among the several states. These general principles, declared in 1824, were made applicable to intercourse upon navigable waters and to vessels propelled by steam, as well as to those navigated by the instrumentality of wind and sails. Gibbons v. Ogden, supra. That they have been applied to the modern means of traffic and intercourse by the instrumentality of railroads as well as to telegraphic communication (West. Union Tel. Co. v. Atlantic  Pacific Tel. Co., 5 Nev. 102 ; Pensacola Tel. Co. v. W. U. Tel. Co., 2 Woods 643) we shall presently see. The sovereignty of congress, being plenary as to the powers conferred by the constitution, is vested absolutely in that blanch of the federal government. The grant by the constitution to congress of the power to regulate interstate commerce carries with it the whole subject, leaving nothing for the state to act upon. The power is exclusive: it can reside in but one potentate. And \"wherever commerce among the states goes, the power of the nation goes with it, to protect and enforce its rights.\" Gilman v. Philadelphia, 3 Wall. 713, 725. But when a state proceeds to regulate commerce among the states, it is exercising the very power that is granted to congress, and is doing the very thing that congress alone is authorized to do.

Law. 138, 141.\n\nThe transportation of freight or of the subjects of commerce is a constituent part of commerce itself. Transportation of passengers or merchandise through a state, or from one state to another, is the subject of a regulation of commerce among the states, and is beyond the reach of state legislation. This power of congressional regulation comprehends the routes and means of travel, transportation, and commercial intercourse within the limits of every state in the Union, so far as those routes, means, and intercourse are connected with commerce among or between the states. Crandall v. Nevada, 6 Wall. 35; Woodruff v. Parham, 8 Wall. 123, 138; The Montello, 11 Wall. 411; The Daniel Ball, supra, in which case Mr. Justice Field remarks, &#8212; \"Whenever a commodity has begun to move as an article of trade from one state to another, commerce in that commodity between the states has commenced. The fact that several and independent agencies are employed in transporting the commodity, some entirely in one state and some acting through two or more states, does in no respect affect the character of the transaction. To the extent in which each agency acts in the transportation it is subject to the regulation of congress.\" Case of the State Freight Tax, 15 Wall. 232, 275, 279-281; Erie Railway v. The State, 31 N. J. (Law) 531; Piek v. Chicago  N.W. Railway, 6 Biss. 177, 182; Camblos v. P.  R. Railroad, 4 Brews. (Penn.) 563, 603; Pennsylvania v. Bridge Co., supra; Almy v. California, 24 How. 169; C. B.  Q. Railroad v. Iowa,  94 U.S. 156 ,  163 . This power was vested in congress to ensure uniformity of commercial regulation against discriminating state legislation. Veazie v. Moor, supra; Welton v. Missouri, supra; The Federalist, Nos. 7, 11, 22 (ed. 1852), 31, 52, 97. And the fact that congress has not seen fit to prescribe any specific rules to govern interstate commerce, especially when considered with reference to its legislation with respect to foreign commerce, is equivalent to a declaration that interstate commerce shall be free and untrammeled. Railroad v. Fuller, 17 Wall. 560; Welton v. Missouri,  91 U.S. 275 ,  282 .\n\nI suppose the legislation of New Hampshire now under consideration will not be claimed to be an exercise of internal police power (Pierce v. The State,  13 N.H. 536 ,  579 . If it were such it could not be exercised by the state, to the obstruction of interstate commerce.\nRailroad v. Huzen,  95 U.S. 473 ), nor that it has reference to a commerce which is completely internal. If such a position shall be assumed by the plaintiffs it will be considered hereafter. In the meantime, for a definition of the extent and characteristics of state police power and regulation, see P. W. B. Railroad v. Bowers, 4 Hous. (Del.) 506, 537; Thorpe v. R.  B. Railroad,  27 Vt. 140 .\n\nThe provision of the United States constitution concerning commerce among the states was not intended to be confined to future commerce carried on in the same mode it then was, before the introduction of steam as a motive power. And it was so held, as we have seen, in the early days of steam navigation, in the case of Gibbons v. Ogden, where the term \"regulation of commerce\" was declared to embrace the whole thing, with all its means, instruments, and appliances. The constitution and the laws of congress never had in contemplation the principle by which vessels or carriages are moved. Concerning, therefore, the application of the constitutional provision to modern means of traffic and transportation, Mr. Justice Redfield remarks, &#8212; \"It is thus made very apparent, from a careful examination of the argument in Gibbons v. Ogden, by which transportation of goods and passengers by steamboats and steam vessels of every kind is brought under the same provisions originally framed for the regulation of that which was carried on by sailing vessels, that if the question had then presented itself to the mind of the court how far railway traffic should be brought under the same power of regulating commerce which had already been extended to the traffic by navigation, there can really be no fair doubt how it would have been determined. The fact that the entire subject of regulating all commerce among the different states, including all the means and appliances by which it was carried on, was committed to congress, and that thereafter the states were to have no concurrent action in the regulation of the same, would seem to reduce the question of congress having the power of regulating interstate railway traffic to the single inquiry whether it forms any portion of the commerce of the country which requires to be regulated at all.\n\n\"Those who assume to argue that congress has no power to regulate the traffic upon these extended lines of railway, reaching from one end of the Union to the other, must, if they would meet the question fairly, either say that the traffic on these extended lines of railway, amounting to many millions annually, probably ten times as much as the entire commerce of the country at the time of the adoption of the constitution, is not commerce at all, or, if it be, that it is not subject to any regulation or control whatever. For it is certain the states have neither the power nor the capacity to regulate, to any purpose or with any efficiency, this interstate railway traffic.\" 1 Redf. Railways 723.\n\nMr. Justice Cooley also remarks, &#8212; \"The principles that at one time applied the power over commerce to the regulation of\nnavigation, at a later day are found equally applicable to traffic by railroad [citing Railroad Co. v. Richmond, 19 Wall. 584] and communication by telegraph; and though these new applications of principle do not in the least depart from or enlarge former doctrines, they nevertheless strengthen greatly the national power by the immensity of the interests it is thus invited to take under its control.\" Cooley Const. Law 38.\n\nTransportation and intercourse by railroad between different parts of the country are under the regulating control of congress wherever they are not exclusively limited to a single state; and under this power congress may provide for the construction and operation of connecting lines. These powers of regulation \"keep pace with the progress of the country and adapt themselves to the new developments of times and circumstances. They extend from the horse with its rider to the stage-coach, from the sailing vessel to the steamboat, from the coach and the steamboat to the railroad, and from the railroad to the telegraph, as these new agencies are successively brought into use to meet the demands of increasing population and wealth. They were intended for the government of the business to which they relate, at all times and under all circumstances. As they were intrusted to the general government for the good of the nation, it is not only the right but the duty of congress to see to it that intercourse among the states and the transmission of intelligence are not obstructed or unnecessarily encumbered by state legislation.\" Cooley Const. Law 65, 67; Pensacola Tel. Co. v. W. U. Tel. Co.,  96 U.S. 1 ,  9 . Congress cannot legislate for the regulation of commerce on a railroad exclusively within the limits of a state, and which does not, by connecting with other railroads, form a continuous route over which commerce is or may be carried on with other states. Veazie v. Moor, 14 How. 568. It is otherwise, however, with a railroad which, though wholly within a state, forms, with connecting roads, a highway for interstate commerce; and the regulation may extend to vehicles and means of transportation, which, even if they be used upon the railway of one state, yet deliver merchandise upon the connecting road. Cooley Const. Law 67; The Daniel Ball, supra; Withers v. Buckley, 20 How. 84; The Bright Star, 1 Woolw. 266; The Montello, 20 Wall. 430.\n\nThe act of congress of June 15, 1866 (14 U.S. St. at Large, c. 124), is entitled \"An act to facilitate commercial, postal, and military communication among the several states.\" Its preamble is as follows: \"Whereas, the constitution of the United States confers upon congress, in express terms, the power to regulate commerce among the several states, to establish post-roads, and to raise and support armies; therefore\" etc. This statute is reenacted by U.S. Rev. St., s. 52, 5258, as follows: \"Every railroad company in the United States whose road is operated by steam, its successors and assigns, is hereby authorized to carry upon and\nover its road, boats, bridges, and ferries, all passengers, troops, government supplies, mails, freight, and property, on their way from any state to another state, and to receive compensation therefor, and to connect with roads of other states so as to form continuous lines for transportation of the same to the place of destination. But this section shall not affect any stipulation between the government of the United States and any railroad company for transportation or fares without compensation, nor impair or change the conditions imposed by the terms of any act granting lands to any such company to aid in the construction of its road, nor shall it be construed to authorize any railroad company to build any new road or connection with any other road without authority from the state in which such railroad or connection may be proposed. And congress may at any time alter, amend, or repeal this section.\"\n\nIn construing, in connection with this act, \"An act to authorize the construction of certain bridges, and establish them as postroads\" (14 U.S. St. at Large 66), Mr. Justice Field says, &#8212; \"These acts were passed under the power vested in congress to regulate commerce among the several states, and were designed to remove trammels upon transportation between different states which had previously existed, and to prevent the creation of such trammels in future, and to facilitate railway transportation by authorizing the construction of bridges over the navigable waters of the Mississippi. They were intended to reach trammels interposed by state enactments or by existing laws of congress. * * The power to regulate commerce among the several states was vested in congress, in order to secure equality and freedom in commercial intercourse against discriminating state legislation. The act of congress was intended to facilitate commercial intercourse among the states, and it is of great public interest that such intercourse should be free and untrammeled.\" Railroad Co. v. Richmond, 19 Wall. 584, 589, 590.\n\nThe peculiar, definite, and distinct language of the limitation clause relates (so far as is pertinent to this discussion) solely to the building of a new or connecting railroad. The definite expression of this limitation, by force of legal construction, excludes any other limitation or restraint upon traffic or contracts concerning traffic, and no other limitation than that expressed by the law of congress can be imposed by state legislation. The exception from a power marks its extent. Gibbons v. Ogden, supra. Any traffic arrangement for the interstate transportation of passengers and freight by means of continuous connecting lines is authorized by the act of congress and is within the scope of its intention? namely, the promotion of untrammelled commercial intercourse. And if this be so, the state laws referred to are nugatory, invalid, and of no effect, if they have any applicability, which we deny, to contracts between connecting roads, like the contract under consideration.\n\nRailroads in New Hampshire are public corporations \"like other highways.\" G. L., c. 160, s. 1. They are constructed and intended solely for purposes of traffic. They are common carriers. Steamship, steamboat, and railway companies, when incorporated and engaged in accomplishing the purposes for which they are created, are commercial corporations Green's Brice's Ultra Vires (2d ed.) 18. Such corporations transact immense amounts of business and may, perhaps, in view of that fact, be well enough called business corporations, but their true legal and constitutional denomination is that of commercial corporations, as they are created for the purpose of transporting passengers and freight, which is a commercial business, involving intercourse and an interchange of commodities. Commerce among the states, like foreign commerce, is subject to the regulation of congress, and, as we have seen, it is well settled law that the word \"commerce\" includes navigation and transportation as well as traffic, and that the power to regulate extends to the vehicles of intercourse, by land or water, as well as the commodities to be carried and exchanged. Congressional regulation may not comprehend that commerce which is completely internal, and which does not extend to or affect other states; but the Concord Railroad is part of a connecting line, intended to promote commercial intercourse among several states. This corporation, with its engines and cars, is certainly a vehicle of commerce among the states, and as such is a commercial corporation within the meaning of the Bankrupt Act (U.S. Rev. St., s. 5122), and its transactions and contracts, so far as they relate to interstate transportation, are proper objects of regulation by congress, under the grant of power to regulate commerce among the states. Pomeroy Const. Law 244. An incorporated bridge company, where it appeared that the bridge was a connecting link between two railroads, was held by the supreme court of the United States to be a commercial corporation. Gilman v. Philadelphia, 3 Wall. 729. Comprehensive as the phrase \"among the states\" is, it may nevertheless be properly restricted to commerce which concerns more states than one; but when railroads incorporated in different states are connected in one continuous line of communication, they are instruments of commerce within the meaning of the constitution, and as such are commercial corporations, and are subject to exclusive congressional regulation.\n\nReported cases, to some of which reference has been made, confirm this construction, and show that the transportation of passengers and freight from one state to another, or through more than one state, whether by land or water, by boat, ship, or railway carriage, is commerce within the meaning of the constitutional provision referred to. And the express power given to congress is comprehensive, complete in itself, and may be exercised to its utmost extent without any limitations other than such as are prescribed by the constitution.\n\"Confessedly railroad corporations are created to transport passengers and freight, and it is that precise business in which they are employed. They must therefore be held to be commercial corporations.\" Sweatt v. B. H.  E. R. R., 3 Cliff. 339, 346, 347, 348, 350, 351. The only regulation or restriction by congress of the powers of a railroad company \"whose road forms any part of a line of road over which cattle, sheep, swine, or other animals are conveyed from one state to another,\" except the limitation contained in the act of congress before cited, is one relating to the proper care of cattle transported in the cars. U.S. Rev. St., ss. 4386, 4387.\n\nState regulation of foreign or interstate commerce is an encroachment upon the power of congress over the subject, and is therefore void, even though congress may never have legislated upon the subject. Welton v. Missouri, supra. By refraining from action, congress in effect adopts as its own regulations those which the common law, or the civil law where that prevails, has provided for the government of such business, and those which the states, in the regulation of their domestic concerns, have established affecting commerce, but not regulating it within the meaning of the constitution. In fact, congressional legislation is only necessary to cure defects in existing laws, as they are discovered, and to adapt such laws to new developments of trade. Hall v. DeCuir,  95 U.S. 485 ,  490 . Inaction by congress is equivalent to a declaration that the commerce under its control shall remain free and untrammeled. Welton v. Missouri, supra; Railroad v. Huzen, supra; County of Mobile v. Kimball,  102 U.S. 691 ,  697 ; Webber v. Virginia, supra. In the cases above mentioned, the state legislation invaded a domain which is appropriated exclusively to the national power. Cooley Const. Law 73. Concerning the concurrent jurisdiction of the several states, an example of state regulation, on a subject which may at the discretion of congress be brought within its exclusive control, is to be found in state pilot laws and harbor regulations. These have been recognized and their validity sustained. Cooley v. Port Wardens, supra; The James Gray v. The John Fraser, 21 How. 184. The states may also pass quarantine laws for their own protection against the introduction of disease from other states or foreign countries. License Cases, 5 How. 504, 632; Conway v. Taylor, 1 Black 603.\n\nThe power that controls the foreign and interstate commerce of the country must have the authority to take this subject under its control as a part of its commercial regulations. Cooley Const. Lim. 74. And this it has done. By the act of 1866, and the reenactment thereof in the Revised Statutes, congress has legislated in such manner as to exclude the authority of any state legislation which shall tend to restrict the capabilities of lawful interstate traffic through the provisions of lawful contracts between connecting railroads. By lawful contracts, I mean contracts not unlawful on general principles, &#8212; contracts lawful without reference\nto the prohibition of unconstitutional state laws. The legislation of congress has been interpreted to mean that all restrictions upon free commercial intercourse between the states by such means and under such regulations as shall best promote the interests of the parties immediately concerned and of the public, and all state legislation which operates directly upon the commerce among the states, either by way of tax upon its business, license upon its pursuit in particular channels only, or conditions for carrying it on, are void. Sherlock v. Alling,  93 U.S. 99 , 102 . If the constitutional view here suggested is approved by the court, the main questions presented by the bill will be disposed of; because, if congress alone has exclusive control of interstate commerce, the limitations claimed to be imposed by our state laws are of no effect, and these corporations may lawfully contract for the management and control of the business in which they are both interested, by any arrangement, not fraudulent, which shall be considered by the contracting parties best calculated to promote their interests and the public good.\n\nIn any consideration of the case, and notwithstanding the presumption of law in favor of the legality of the contract, the defendants should not be deprived of the opportunity of showing its real purpose, practical operation, and effect, which can only be made clearly and fully apparent by the evidence which the plaintiffs seek to exclude. When that evidence shall be presented, it will be demonstrated that the contract is intended, and its effect will be to promote not only the mutual interests of the parties but of the public, both as to the mode of transaction and the tariff of the joint business, as well as in all other matters relating thereto, by enabling the management under the contract to conduct the business \"with greater facility and regularity, and at a greater saving of expense to both parties, through a more efficient and more economical joint operation,\" affording \"better security of their respective investments, as well as the convenience and interest of the public.\" Whatever state legislation, in conflict with these purposes and results, tends to prevent, obstruct, or embarrass the regularity, facility, efficiency, convenience, or economy of interstate railway transportation and traffic, or to prevent or impair the making of fair and honest contracts relating thereto, is unconstitutional and void, as well as contrary to true public policy.\n\nWe contend, therefore, &#8212; 1. The contract is infra vires of the contracting parties. 2. It is not prohibited by the statutes of the state. 3. It is expressly authorized by the statutes of the state. 4. Any attempt at state legislative prohibition of such contracts is in conflict with the constitution and laws of the United States, repugnant thereto, and of no effect.\n\nOral argument of J. H. George, for the defendants. This is, as has been suggested, an application by the plaintiffs for a temporary\ninjunction to be heard before this court upon the contract which it is admitted has been executed and is in operation, and upon the laws of the state of New Hampshire and of the United States, and upon the charter of the road. My brethren take two grounds: First, that this contract is in plain violation of the laws of New Hampshire; and, second, that it is ultra vires. My position is, that not only is it not in conflict with any law of the state, but that it is in accordance with and justified by the laws of New Hampshire, and that no law exists today, or ever has existed, to prohibit a beneficial contract of this character. And I also hold, and am able to show that instead of being ultra vires, beyond the powers of the corporation, it is infra vires, and within its power. I desire, in discussing this first branch of the subject, before I come to the other question, as to what are the incidental powers of a corporation, to ask your honors' attention to the laws as they were passed, to the times when they were passed, to the circumstances under which they were passed, and to the acts which for the last thirty years have been done under these laws. I shall be pardoned, I trust, for giving briefly a short historical review of the beginning and growth of railroad interests in the state, and of the laws which were passed from time to time to regulate and control these interests; because, in the interpretation of these statutes, as it seems to me, the court should give especial attention to the circumstances under which they were enacted.\n\nThe first statute that was passed regulating contracts made by railroad corporations, as I believe, will be found in the Revised Statutes, 1842, c. 142, s. 10. It was originally passed in 1841, and gave power to railroad corporations to contract with other railroad corporations for the transportation of freight and passengers, and the conducting of all business connected therewith. So far as I am able to discover, there was no change from the law of 1842 giving this plenary and absolute power to railroad corporations to contract as they chose in regard to business done over their rail roads, until the year 1850; and I will call the attention of the court to the statute then passed, after I have stated the facts with reference to the extension of railroads before and between those times.\n\nThe first railroad that extended into the state was the Nashua  Lowell Railroad, which was built to Nashua, I think, in the year 1838. Therefore, this statute of 1842 simply applied to that railroad as an existing corporation; for the Concord Railroad, which was the next railroad extending into New Hampshire having any connection whatever with any other railroad in the state, was opened to Concord in September, 1842. Hence this general statute of 1842 was undoubtedly intended to apply to the Concord Railroad, which was then about to be opened, and to the Nashua  Lowell Railroad, three or four miles of which in this state had been opened some three years before. In 1847, 1848, 1849, and 1850 a\nvery large number of railroads were constructed within this state, &#8212; the Northern Railroad, the Claremont Railroad, the Montreal Railroad, the Cheshire Railroad, the Boston  Maine Railroad, and others. Prior to that time, the Eastern Railroad in New Hampshire had been commenced, and I am not certain whether it had been extended to Portsmouth prior to 1842. The railroads within the state had been largely constructed prior to 1850.\n\nThe law entitled An act in relation to railroad corporations, Laws 1850, c. 353, s. 8, provides that \"no contract between two or more railroad corporations for the use of their roads shall be legal or binding, unless such contract shall be sanctioned in writing by the railroad commissioners, and approved by the governor and council.\" I beg your honors' attention to the peculiar wording of the statute, because I think I shall be able to show exactly to what class of contracts this statute refers. The law of 1850 was intended to apply to just two cases. It embraced the lease of one road to another, because a lease is a contract for the use of one road by another; and it embraced contracts common in those days, by which one road used in common, for its own purposes, the road of another. Those were the two classes of contracts, and the only two classes, covered by the term \"contracts for the use of a road,\" namely, leases and contracts by which one road used another road for its own purposes, &#8212; precisely as though the Northern Railroad, by virtue of a contract, should run its train through to Manchester, or through to Nashua, over the Concord Railroad, for a specified sum, and under its own control. Prior to that statute there were a large number of cases where one road had taken a lease of another. And there were a smaller number of cases, but still quite a number, where one road had obtained the right to a common use of another. And the instances were numerous in which that class of contracts were executed. The legislature said we will not make legal and binding a contract which shall pass any road out of its own control into the control of another road, so far as the running of trains upon that road is concerned, without the sanction of the governor and council and the railroad commissioners, because that is dangerous, and because that is parting with the franchise. To show I am right as to the interpretation of this statute, and the intention of the legislature, I ask your honors' attention to the statute that was passed the next year. While the above law remained on the statute book precisely as I have read it, the next year, 1851, there was passed another statute (Comp. Sts. 352), which is as follows: \"In all cases where railroads are unable to agree upon terms of connection, or on referees to whom the same be submitted, either road, in such case, may apply to the superior court, or any two justices thereof, who are disinterested, in vacation, for the appointment of an impartial and disinterested board of referees. And the superior court of said justices, on due notice to the opposite party, shall appoint such\nboard of referees to adjust and determine all matters of connection between said roads, whose report shall be final and conclusive between the parties, for such term as said referees may award, not exceeding one year, or such further time as the parties may agree upon.\"\n\nIf the interpretation which my brethren put upon the statute of 1850 is correct, &#8212; if a contract providing that the cars, and the brakemen, and the switchmen, and the baggagemen, being furnished by one road, may run over another road, as must be the case under any arrangement for connection, &#8212; if such a contract is embraced within the statute of 1850, and is a contract for the use of one road by another within the meaning thereof, then the statute of 1851, which provided that if the parties disagree upon the terms of connection, or on referees, either party may apply to the court, and referees should be appointed, and they should make the award, and the award should stand for one year, and as much longer as the parties wanted, it was a repeal of that statute, was it not? The parties certainly had a right to agree, for the law provides what may be done if they disagree. The statute did not say that the award was to be subject to the approval of the governor and council and railroad commissioners. It was to continue so long as the parties should agree that it was a fair and judicious contract fixing the terms of connection.\n\nSubsequently, in 1855, I think, the legislature took out of the statute of 1850 the right to lease with the approval of the governor and council and the railroad commissioners, and said that no lease should be made of one road to another without the authority of the legislature. The statute giving the right of connection, and the statute providing that no contract by one road for the use of. another road should be valid for more than five years, nor without the sanction of the railroad commissioners and the governor and council, were left on the statute book, but they abstracted from the latter the power which existed before, of making a lease for five years with the approval suggested, and left it so that no contract of lease should be binding or valid without the assent of the legislature. This explains, and explains perfectly, the apparent discrepancy and collision between these two statutes. The original statute covered the lease; and the original statute covered the right to use in common a railroad. It did not refer to contracts between roads governing the terms of connection; it had no relation to a contract between the Northern Railroad and the Concord Railroad, for example, by which the Northern might send passengers over the Concord, accompanied by its own brakemen, baggagemen, and conductors, if need be, for the purpose of doing a connecting business; but it simply left that to be governed by the statute providing that the railroads might make terms of connection for their connecting business, as they could agree, and failing to agree, the court, upon petition of either party, might appoint a board of\nreferees, whose decision should be final for a year, and for such further time as the parties might agree. I have attended many hearings under this statute; and referees have been appointed under it, and courts have awarded judgment upon the award of such referees over and over again. There have been many controversies between the Montreal Railroad and the Concord Railroad, and between various other connecting railroads of this character, and now is the first time it has ever been suggested that such a contract required the sanction of the governor and council and the railroad commissioners. I make this suggestion to the court for two reasons: I hold that there is such a thing as honest, fair, and straightforward dealing with the public; I hold that a man has no right, when a contract is made involving public interests, to turn around and denounce it as fraudulent, and a plain and palpable violation of the law, and accuse men of acting not only contrary to their convictions and contrary to the plain principles of common honesty, but contrary to the plain statute of the state, and then, when he has incorporated those charges in a bill in equity, come here, and, refusing all investigation and furnishing no proof, simply say, \"There is a presumption of the defendant's innocence.\"\n\nThere have been probably a thousand contracts entered into between the upper roads and the lower roads determining the rates and the manner in which the business should be done, fixing at what rate one road should draw the cars of another, at what rate and in what way one road should be paid for the use of the cars of another, how brakemen and other trainmen should be paid, who should bear the risks, and determining all the questions involved in railroad connections, and not one of these contracts has ever been submitted to the governor and council for approval; and heretofore there has never been from any quarter, so far as I know, a suggestion that a contract of that character required such approval.\n\nOne would suppose from what has been said, that this contract is one of the most extraordinary character ever known in the annals of infamy, one that is to deprive the people of their public rights and the stockholders of their private rights; and yet every man of common intelligence familiar with the general subject knows that from 1857 to 1879, a contract, of which this is a substantial and almost verbatim copy, existed between the Nashua Lowell Railroad and the Boston  Lowell Railroad, and was in operation during all these years, without the suggestion of legal objection from any quarter; and my brother can hardly say that no party had an interest in investigating and opposing that contract. The question of the right of the Concord Railroad to make an arrangement with the Lawrence Railroad was before the community and before the court; and yet that arrangement, to a very marked extent, was influenced and determined, necessarily determined, practically by the contract existing between the Boston  Lowell\nRailroad and the Nashua  Lowell Railroad, to which I have referred; and during all that controversy we had these able gentlemen here, but they did not regard that contract as an embodiment of infamy, and in opposition to the laws of the state.\n\nThinking this contract to be wise and legal, thinking it a contract beneficial to the state, thinking it to be a contract which not entered into would be destructive to the best interests of the state I advised it. Nowhere do the laws of New Hampshire prevent the making of a contract regulating the terms of connection between railroads. Our laws specially provide that railroads may make such contracts. Any man who has had any practical experience in the operation of railroads knows that you cannot run a connecting railroad without such contracts. You can neither have a line of railroad from Franklin to Nashua, or from there to Boston, or do business thereon, without connections, and you cannot have connections without contracts. For illustration: How long would the community permit connecting railroads to dump their freight and passengers at the termination of each? How long would they submit to the nuisance of it? How long would they submit to the expense of it? How long would they submit to the delay of it? And yet, according to my brother's idea of the powers of a railroad under its charter, it has no right as an incident to its powers, because it is not expressly granted, to send its cars over another road, or permit the cars of another road to run over its road. My brother has devoted several pages of his brief to showing, what I thought was elementary, that a railroad has no powers except such as are expressly granted, or are reasonably necessary to the grant. The powers expressly granted are very easy to be determined. But what are the incidental powers of a railroad is an entirely different question. If you look at the charter of the Boston  Lowell Railroad of 1830, the first railroad charter granted in New England you will find that, under the strict letter of that charter, it has not any right to run a railroad at all. It has the right to build and complete a railroad, but nowhere in that charter, from beginning to end, does it give the right to run cars over the road, or to operate the road. Why not? Because at the time the charter of the Boston  Lowell Railroad was granted, the idea was that the road would be operated precisely like a turnpike; and the charter gives, with great minuteness of detail, the right to fix upon the weight of loads, the style of carriages, and the strength of the wheels, to erect toll-gates, to collect tolls; and nowhere in the letter of the charter is there given the right to run and operate the railroad as it is today. The whole theory was, that the railroad would be used by parties who would furnish their own motive power and their own cars; while the directors would have the right to supervise the weight of loads, the character of the motive power, the strength of wheels, etc.\n\nWhen the road was chartered, it was entirely uncertain whether\nit could be operated by steam power; and the report of the commissioner, who was appointed by the legislature to consider, investigate, and report upon the practical construction of a road from Boston to Lowell, reported that while he had not any reasonable doubt that a railroad could be built from Boston to Lowell, the question whether or not it could be operated by steam power was another and entirely different question; that if the experiments then in progress in Great Britain should show it could be operated by steam power, then he should recommend such and such constructions; if, on the other hand, those experiments should prove a failure, resort would have to be made to animal power; and he made the suggestion that if it should be operated by steam power, he should recommend the construction of two parallel tracks, without turn-outs; whereas, if it should be operated by animal power, he would recommend a single track, with turn-outs equally distant. I mention this to show how this matter has grown. It shows that the things contemplated at the time of the charter of this road did not reach one hundredth part of the capacity which they were inevitably granting by granting the charter. Now for illustration: At the time the Boston  Lowell Railroad was chartered, in 1830, statistics were introduced before the legislature showing that the total number of passengers between Boston and Lowell by private conveyances and stages was from thirty thousand to thirty-seven thousand per year. Last year the Boston  Lowell Railroad, with the Fitchburg Railroad on one side and the Boston  Maine Railroad on the other, each accommodating a large portion of the business originally contemplated to be done by the Boston \nLowell Railroad, carried more than three millions of people. In the statistics at that time they assumed that the manufacturing corporations of Lowell furnished sixteen tons of freight per day, and they thought that eight tons per day would cover the freight from outside parties, making twenty-four tons per day, or seven thousand four hundred tons per year. Last year the Boston  Lowell Railroad carried a million tons over its rails. They supposed, when they chartered the Boston  Lowell Railroad, it was to do this small amount of business. Yet there was one thing that was quite remarkable, that this commissioner, who reported that it was doubtful whether it could be operated by steam power, and that it might have to be operated by animal power, put in the report, which I have here before me, the wise suggestion and the pregnant one, that a line of railroad from Boston to Lowell would ultimately be part and parcel of a line extending up through New Hampshire into Vermont, and to the Canadas, and that it should be constructed with a view to such a result. Mr. Heywood, thirty years ago, saw that a railroad situated like that road must, for the accommodation of the people and of the country, be extended as a connecting line through New Hampshire and into Vermont &#8212; I believe he stopped at Canada; and yet we have men today who\nare worried because an arrangement is made between railroads seventy-five miles long, by which a very large portion of the running expenses may be saved, and by which twice the accommodation can be afforded, and at cheaper rates to the community; we have men earnest to take the community under their control, and protect its rights against an operation of that character. They come here and ask the court for an injunction without an investigation; and the defendants come in and say, \"We ask no delay; we will accept service of notice; we will take our testimony at once; we will lay before the court all the facts pertaining to this case, and at the next term the court can pass upon the case intelligently.\" They object to the offer, and oppose any suggestion which will enable the court to see the bearing of the law on the facts, and the bearing of the facts on the law, and then instruct their counsel to come here and say that every one is presumed to be innocent until proved guilty. When the defendants ask to be investigated, they say that creates a suspicion of fraud, for no one wants to be investigated but he who has done wrong!\n\nWhat is absolutely essential to railroad connection? Let me again repeat that the express powers granted in the charter are easily determined. Their incidental powers depend upon the facts of the case. The charter of the Boston  Lowell Railroad does not give the Boston  Lowell Railroad a right to run the road at all. Supposing the theory under which the Boston \nLowell Railroad was chartered had proved to be true, &#8212; that it could only be operated by horse power; that the people who use it would have to put on their own horses and carriages, precisely as they run canal boats, or use turnpikes: and supposing the Boston  Lowell Railroad had built a lot of locomotives, and a bill in equity had been filed, complaining that the Boston  Lowell Railroad, instead of confining itself to the ownership of the iron rail turnpike, and keeping it in repair, was building expensive machines: there is no court in the world but on the showing of those facts unexplained would grant an injunction against the Boston  Lowell Railroad for diverting its funds to build locomotives, because those locomotives had no connection with the operation of the road. But if a bill in equity should be filed, setting forth that it was a charter for an iron turnpike, and that they were thus expending their money, and it appeared that the use of locomotives was essential to the running of the road, the court would be of the opinion that the building of locomotives was an incident to the powers of the corporation under their charter.\n\nSupposing some stockholder in the Boston  Lowell Railroad should file a bill in equity, setting forth that it was diverting its funds for the purpose of erecting a line of telegraph, saying, \"We ask an injunction. Here is a contract showing that they have contracted to build a line of telegraph, and there is their charter, which does not mention anything about building a line of telegraph.\nA railroad is one thing, and a telegraph is another thing. We don't want evidence introduced here at all.\" The railroad answers, &#8212; \"We propose to show that the erection of a line of telegraph on the line of the road is essential to the safe operation of the road. We propose to run our road by telegraph. We propose to show that all the first-class roads in the country run by telegraph, and that a road cannot be run safely in any other way.\" Is there no occasion for showing the facts as bearing on the question whether the matter is ultra vires, or infra vires?\n\nWe assume that it is the right of railroads to make \"terms of connection.\" What do \"terms of connection\" mean? We think that roads may make business contracts by which passengers and freight may be forwarded from one road over another road in such a way and upon such terms as shall afford the public proper accommodation, and shall be fair and honest between the roads. For illustration, let us take the Concord Railroad and the Northern Railroad. Probably ninety per cent. of all the freight and travel that goes over the Northern Railroad is connecting business with the Concord Railroad; probably ninety per cent. runs down past the junction of the two roads. The travel of the Northern Railroad must either change cars at Concord, and change cars at Nashua if it goes beyond, and change cars at Lowell if it goes beyond there, or else the Northern Railroad must make some contract with all the roads below for the running of its cars through to Boston. It may be said, &#8212; \"Very well, let the Northern Railroad run its cars down through, and let the Lowell Railroad run its cars up through.\" In the first place that involves a contract; but in the second place an arrangement of that kind involves the necessity of both sets of cars going empty one way, and it takes just twice as many cars to do the business as it would if the arrangement were that one road should furnish all the cars for the through business. If we have an opportunity, we will show the exact manner in which these connecting contracts have been made for the last forty years.\n\nAt an early day, when the Northern Railroad was built, it made arrangements, for instance, that the Northern Railroad should charge from Franklin to Boston the combined local fares, that is, the fare from Concord to Boston, and the fare from Franklin to Concord; that it should furnish cars for the passengers; and that the lower roads would allow to the Northern Railroad half a cent per mile for each passenger in its cars; and the Northern Railroad under that contract was required to take all risks; &#8212; that is, if the passenger met with any injury between Concord and Boston under this contract, which was one of the earliest of these contracts, the Northern Railroad, for the thirty-seven and a half cents that it got for furnishing cars from Concord to Boston for its passengers, stood in for the damages; and it furnished brakemen to run through on its cars, and accounted to the lower roads for their local fares.\nNow, suppose my brethren should say that the Concord Railroad had a \"toll granted them by its charter for the sole benefit of the corporation,\" and therefore the contract between the Northern Railroad and the Concord Railroad, by which half a cent per mile should be allowed the Northern Railroad for furnishing cars for connecting passengers, was ultra vires, would that be argument? It is impossible that there should be a connecting contract without embodying arrangements of that character. Do your honors ask what occasion there was for requiring the Northern Railroad to take the risk of its passengers in the case supposed? Supposing that when the passenger got to Nashua there was ice on the step, or the platform was out of order, and the man should break his leg-: what occasion was there for the Northern Railroad to take that risk? I grant that incidental powers must be reasonable powers; but whether they are reasonable or not depends on the circumstances of the case. Let us see why that contract was proper. Here is a train from the Northern Railroad; it gets on the Concord Railroad, and the brakeman who accompanies it is the brakeman of the Northern Railroad; &#8212; suppose he brings up these cars too suddenly, and thereby causes an accident: the accident is occasioned by the servant of the Northern Railroad; &#8212; supposing the accident occurs from the car trucks not being in repair; then, also, the accident was occasioned by the negligence of the Northern Railroad. Supposing the brakeman does his duty, supposing the car is all right, and supposing the track is out of order, and there is a smash-up: then the accident is due to the Concord Railroad; &#8212; supposing the accident happens through the carelessness of the engineer: then the Concord Railroad is considered in fault. But the great trouble is, the cause of the accident is generally hidden, and no power on earth can tell its origin, whether it was the carelessness of the brakeman, defect in the car, defect in the track, or the fault of the engineer; whether a defective wheel breaks the track, or a defective track breaks the wheel; and in order to save all controversy, and because there is no other way to arrive at it, the custom has been for the upper and lower roads to allow a certain sum of money or certain rights to other roads for assuming the risk of injury to their passengers from whatever cause the passengers are injured.\n\nThen take freight: The freight of the Northern Railroad comes down to Concord. Is there a man who says that freight ought to be changed at the junction? He could put people to a great deal of inconvenience; he could make great and unnecessary expense and delay; and then he would not avoid the difficulty which is suggested as the reason why this contract is ultra vires, &#8212; because you cannot transfer freight from one road to another road without having facilities for transfer, which would have to be furnished by one road, or by the other road, or by both roads; and those facilities would have to be the subject-matter of contract. A contract that\nwould be perfectly infra vires so far as the Northern Railroad and the Concord Railroad are concerned, and so far as the Concord Railroad and the Boston  Lowell and Nashua  Lowell railroads are concerned, would be ultra vires so far as the Northern Railroad and the Rutland Railroad are concerned, which have no business connections. The rights of corporations, from the necessities of the case, depend upon circumstances. I do not claim that a contract of this kind made between the Concord Railroad and the Cheshire Railroad, or between two roads having no business connection, would be valid. The right to make this contract grows out of the necessities and situation of these roads as they are recognized by the statutes of New Hampshire, recognized by the people after forty years of experience, recognized because it is the only way in which business can be done, having regard either to convenience, safety, or economy. Do my brethren claim that the existing contracts between the Montreal Railroad and the Northern Railroad, and the various roads on through to Boston, are ultra vires? Do they claim that because no one of these contracts has been submitted to the governor and council and the railroad commissioners for their approval, they are null and void and without effect? But those contracts, every one of them, and every other connecting contract in New Hampshire, cover in principle everything embraced in this contract between the Boston  Lowell and Concord Railroad corporations. They run their cars through; one train comes down on the Montreal Railroad for Boston; there are say ten passengers at the Concord station; they get into the same cars which came down the Montreal road, and they are carried to Manchester, or they are carried to Nashua; and an arrangement is made between the roads by which the upper road accommodates in its cars the business of the lower road, in order to save expense, in order to save time, and in order to accommodate the public. And yet, if that contract is ultra vires, when a passenger comes down the Montreal road the train in which he comes is to be set one side, and not a single passenger is to get into that train, because an arrangement that these through cars might be used for the common purposes of both local and through roads is ultra vires under the charter of the Concord Railroad and the laws of New Hampshire.\n\nWe will not only show, if we have an opportunity to show it, what the uniform practice for forty years has been, both on this road and on every line where there are connecting roads, but we will show that business cannot be done in any other way, having regard either to economy or efficiency; and we will show that contracts covering the same principle have existed between all railroad corporations in the state that are part and parcel of the same line. Let us go further. We will show to this court, if we have an opportunity to show it, that of the Concord Railroad business ninety-three per cent. of the tonnage is through freight, and\nseven per cent. of the tonnage is local freight, that is, starts at some point on the Concord Railroad and ends at some point on the same road. Ninety-three per cent. is through connecting business; and that is a very material thing, as bearing upon the propriety of this contract, because any arrangement that is made for the connecting business must of necessity be an arrangement for the local business, because the local business is a very small incident to the connecting business.\n\nThe local business is so small an incident to the connecting business of the Concord Railroad that it is absolutely impossible for any man, however expert he may be, to separate the expenses of doing one kind of business from the expenses of doing the other kind: the thing cannot be done. Take a very simple illustration. Tonight there will be brought down over the Montreal Railroad, and over the Northern Railroad from the city of Montreal, two trains of cars through Concord to Boston; they will unite here at Concord. These cars belong either to the Montreal Railroad on the one hand, or to the Central Vermont and Northern railroads on the other hand: in all, four cars. Ten men get into those cars at Concord, and ride to Manchester or Nashua; that is local business. What is the expense to the railroad of carrying the ten men in those cars? There are two hundred through passengers: ten passengers get in here to go to Manchester or Nashua. You are called upon to divide the expense of carrying these two classes of passengers. Where is the man that can do it? Do any of these gentlemen claim to do it by some ingenious way of figuring? No honest and intelligent man will assert that it is possible to do it. So it runs all through the business of these connecting roads. You might take from the Concord Railroad every dollar of its income from its purely local business, and it would not be impoverished: today it is saving under this arrangement more than double what its entire local business amounts to. Nothing in the world but the prosperity of the Concord Railroad, having such a large amount of business that it could afford every species of extravagance, has tolerated the condition of things which has existed for the last thirty years in the operations of the roads between here and Boston. Look at it &#8212; seventy-five miles of track from here to Boston; &#8212; take an engine from an engine-house at Boston that cost $14,000; put on that engine an engineer with three or four dollars a day salary, and a fireman with a dollar or two salary. It takes two hours for that engine to heat up ready to start; you attach the engine to the train, and before you have got it fairly under way you have reached Lowell, twenty-six miles; you set it out on a side-track, because it would be ultra vires to run it any further, and your engineer and fireman, with an aggregate salary of six dollars a day, sit watching it cool off. Then you put on another engine costing $14,000, which you commence to heat up an hour before the first engine started from Boston, and you put on another\nengineer and another fireman, and go fifteen miles farther; and you set that off on a side-track because it would be ultra vires to run it any further. You hitch on a third engine, which you began to heat up before the first engine left Boston, and put on another engineer and fireman, and run another thirty-five miles up to Concord. You use $42,000 worth of engines, and you use three engineers and three firemen to get a passenger train seventy-five miles when two hundred miles is a moderate day's work for a locomotive, because it is ultra vires: it is a great fraud to make an arrangement by which an engine shall be run through as well as the cars! There would be some little sense in changing a passenger car when you get to Lowell, because the cost of that is only three or four thousand dollars, and you would need no one to watch it; but your engine cost $14,000, and you have to have somebody watch it while it cools off. The connecting business between the Boston  Lowell and the Concord railroads is the great mass of business of the Concord Railroad; and we have the right to make arrangements for that connecting business so that it can be done honestly, faithfully, and for the best interests of the public. It is absolutely impossible from the nature of things to show what the expense is of doing the local business in connection with other business, so as to arrive at any other than purely arbitrary results. Your cars, so far as the connecting business is concerned, must necessarily be used in common if you do a connecting business under any sort of contract.\n\nWe are prepared to show that the directors of these two roads took the business of the roads, and ascertained what the result had been for years. They showed what the increase had been on the one road and on the other; and instead of saying, we will allow you for your cars an arbitrary sum, so much; for taking the risk we will allow you an arbitrary sum, so much; and for brakemen and baggagemen we will allow you an arbitrary sum, so much, &#8212; they said, we will arrange this connecting business upon a basis which is the result of a careful and fair investigation of what each road has earned, and what it can earn; and we will appoint a manager, who shall be a common manager, the Concord Railroad retaining its rights and the Boston \nLowell Railroad retaining its rights and we will divide just as we have before under separate management, giving to the public and the roads the savings which can thereby be made. If that was not a contract which would commend itself to every honest and fair-minded business man, looking at the interests of all parties, then I am grossly deceived.\n\nYou may take up the rails between the Northern and Montreal and Concord railroads, and require the transshipment of every ton of freight and the transfer of every passenger here at the Concord depot, and you would not check in the least degree the travel from points beyond the state of New Hampshire to Boston. It would be like stopping one of four streams of water: you stop up this\nstream, and the freight and travel take one of the other routes around the state. This route through Concord is an important route to New Hampshire; but you can wipe it out of existence today, and every ton of freight and every passenger from beyond our limits would reach Boston just as efficiently, and just as well, and at just the same price, by some other route. And the practical question that is presented today is, whether or not the public shall have this route as cheap, as efficient, as accommodating and as perfect as any other route, or whether they shall have it a route at all, &#8212; whether they shall have the business turned around the state instead of having the business go through the state.\n\nDo my friends say, although we may make arrangements for through business, we have not any right to make arrangements for local business in the same connection? The Concord Railroad and the Northern Railroad probably make the same arrangement that is made between terminal roads everywhere; &#8212; that is, the Concord Railroad owns the depot at Concord, and the Northern Railroad runs into that depot; they have a common ticket-master there; he sells tickets in the Concord Railroad office for the Northern Railroad, and the Concord Railroad has no interest in those tickets. One man goes to that ticket-office and buys of the Concord Railroad ticket-master a ticket to Claremont, but he does not touch the Concord Railroad after he gets out of the depot. Another goes to the same ticket-master, and buys a ticket to Franklin. I am not aware that the Concord Railroad has any interest in that ticket; in other words, the Claremont and the Northern railroads pot only make an arrangement by which the Concord Railroad furnishes a depot for connecting business between the Concord Railroad and the Northern Railroad, but make an arrangement for the accommodation of the entire business of the Northern and Claremont railroads, originating and terminating at Concord.\n\nThe same is true in regard to the local freight of the Northern Railroad, which goes into the hands of the freight-master of the Concord Railroad under a contract; and why? Because it can be done cheaper and better in that way than in any other; &#8212; and yet I suppose my brother would say, \"It is ultra vires; a toll is granted to the Concord Railroad for the sole benefit of the stockholders of the Concord Railroad; therefore these arrangements are illegal, which include in the contract between the connecting roads a provision that their agent at Concord should also be the agent of each of those roads in care of their local business, in which the Concord Railroad has no interest.\" If any one should undertake to run the Concord railroad with the idea that it would have nothing to do with the freight or passengers of any road except its own, we should have at Concord a passenger station for the Montreal Railroad, one for the Concord Railroad, one for the Claremont Railroad, one for the Northern Railroad, one for the Vermont Central and Grand Trunk railroads, and so on ad infinitum. My point is, where the\nlocal business is the mere incident of the other business, and the expenses cannot be separated, a contract regulating connecting business is no more void because it embraces local business, than a contract involving the use of this depot for connecting business is void because the local passenger starts from the same depot by virtue of the same contract.\n\nThe counsel may say that the contract is fraudulent, that it is pretended that it is for the connecting business, while as a matter of fact the purpose is to form a partnership between the railroads. Should this be their claim, let me say, we agree with them most perfectly, that if the contract has an element of fraud, if the contract has a scintilla of unfairness, if there is any false pretence in the contract from beginning to end, if it is not what it purports to be and the evidence does not show that it is what it purports to be, namely, a business arrangement for doing the connecting business of these two roads, then I grant that it is not only ultra vires, but is a contract justified neither by law, fact, nor honesty; and it is because I claim that it is exactly the reverse of what is charged, that I ask that it may be fully investigated.\n\nThere cannot be the slightest doubt in regard to congress under the constitution of the United States having precisely the same power, not only from the same instrument, but from the same sentence in that instrument, the same clause of it, to regulate interstate commerce as it does commerce between this country and a foreign nation. My brother today passed a high encomium upon Chief-Justice Redfield; and if he will look in Redfield on Railways, he will find that the author lays it down that there is no distinction between our great lines of railroads and our great navigable rivers; that the same principles apply to the one that will apply to the other; that commerce not only includes the rivers and steamboats, but the freight and passengers which are on those rivers and steamboats, passing from one state to another; &#8212; it equally includes our great lines of railroads and the cars and travellers and freight which pass over them from one section of the country to another. Nowhere is it suggested that any contrary view or any contrary policy can be maintained. Supposing congress had failed to act upon the subject, then, permissively, the state could act. But when congress has acted, the power of congress becomes exclusive, and the states are deprived of all power over the subject-matter. I do not want to be understood that the states are deprived of police power, that the states cannot control the method in which corporations may be operated under the police power, but I am talking about the question of determining the terms of connection between railroads extending from one state to or through another state. Although they exist in the same state, if they are a part and parcel of a connecting line extending through different states, then under the law of congress they have the right to connect, and all the rights incident to connection.\n\nThe claim is, that the right to connect means the right of physical connection, the right of material connection, the right of putting one rail against another rail. The statute says that whereas congress has the right of regulating interstate commerce under the constitution of the United States, therefore every railroad in any state on which steam is used shall have the right to transport merchandise and to do certain other things, and to connect with any other railroad on which steam is used. The statute then goes on to say that this shall not give the right to construct any new railroad. If the statute is to give the right of physical connection simply, that physical connection either exists, or it does not exist. If it does exist, the statute does not give any right at all; if it does not exist, it cannot be made to exist without building a new road, because you have got to build a new road to put the two rails together; but the statute gives no right to construct any new road. Therefore, if it is a physical connection, the statute is a mere nullity. But the statute does not mean any such thing. The statute means that any railroad upon which steam is used in one state shall have the right to connect with any similar railroad in any other state which is a part of an interstate line of communication, &#8212; that is, it shall have a right to a business connection; it shall have the right to make all contracts which are necessary and essential to carry out that connection, or else it is a farce. To say they have the right of connection if connection exists is absurd; and if it means physical connection, to say they have the right of connection, and shall not have the right to make one, is equally absurd. If a railroad constitutes part of a connecting line between different states, no one state can block it up, any more than New Jersey can impose a tax on passengers going through that state in order to derive a revenue for the state.\n\nAfter the foregoing arguments, the counsel for the defendants submitted the following as their understanding of the facts:\n\n1. The object of the contract between the Boston  Lowell Railroad and the Concord Railroad is to insure honesty, efficiency, and economy in the management of the contracting roads, and this effect is being secured by the practical operation of said contract.\n\n2. The great mass of the business of the Concord Railroad is connecting business with the Boston  Lowell Railroad and commerce between the several states.\n\n3. The Concord Railroad and the Boston  Lowell Railroad are operated by steam, and constitute part of a connecting line of railroads extending through several states, and have been operated and so used for connecting business and interstate commerce for many years.\n\n4. Over said roads are now, and for many years have been, run postal cars of the United States and passenger and freight cars, by means of which mails, persons, and property are carried, without\ndelay or transshipment, through several states and from one state to another.\n\n5. The Concord Railroad was opened for business in 1842, and has since been continuously operated. The local business has been so small that no regular local train, either passenger or freight, has ever been run over the road, or has been or is now required. Its local business has always been done as an incident to its connecting and interstate business, and must continue to be so done.\n\n6. Among the necessary subject-matters of connecting contracts between railroads are, &#8212; the use of cars, the risk to passengers and freight, the employment of trainmen, the furnishing of motive power and track, the regulation of the number and character of trains, the sale of tickets, the loading and unloading of freights, the furnishing of depot accommodations and terminal facilities, the making and guaranteeing of collections, the establishment and regulation of joint fares and freights, the appointment of agents and the expense of agencies and advertising, the running of express and postal cars, in addition to a great mass of minor details dependent upon the existing circumstances of each case. The adjustment and compensation for all these services must be determined by arbitrary rates, because their cost is incapable of definite computation.\n\n7. Prior to 1850, the time of the passage of the law limiting the right of railroads to contract with each other by lease or for common use, it was the practice of railroads to execute leases, and to hire the right to run their trains, under their own control, over another railroad.\n\n8. Since 1850 many hundreds of contracts regulating connecting business and involving many millions of dollars have been made, modified, and annulled, between connecting railroads in this state, and between railroads in this state and connecting railroads in other states, and in no instance has any such contract or action thereon been submitted to the governor and council or board of railroad commissioners for their approval or sanction, and no suggestion has hitherto been made as to the necessity or propriety of such approval or sanction.\n\n9. In such contracts provision has necessarily been made for the furnishing of cars and employes of one road to run through over the connecting road upon an agreed rate of compensation, providing how the risk to passengers and freight throughout the entire route shall be sustained, in what manner the rates of fare and freight shall be fixed or arranged, and generally how and upon what terms the connecting business shall be done; and such provisions, in whole or in part, are inseparable from such contracts.\n\n10. In ordinary connecting contracts provision necessarily is made for the arbitrary adjustment of each of these matters separately, and in the present contract the same result is reached by an aggregate settlement of all these matters, based upon a fair percentage ascertained by past experience.\n\n11. Upon connecting trains it is impossible to prevent a portion of the local business being done between the principal stations on the road; and where, as must be done in the case of these contracting parties, the local, connecting, and interstate business is done upon the same trains, any even approximate separation of the expenses of the local from those of the connecting business is impossible. In such cases the determination of such expenses is merely arbitrary, and dependent upon extraneous circumstances. Any contract regulating the connecting business, where local business is incident, must directly or indirectly embrace the local business.\n\n12. In all contracts regulating connecting business, which embrace the common use of cars and the common employment of trainmen and other employes, the contracting roads have of necessity a joint interest in the subject-matter of such contracts, and in the proceeds derived therefrom.\n\n13. From the first inception of connecting contracts, the Boston  Lowell Railroad, as the principal terminal road, has, as a business necessity and by contract, made and guaranteed the bulk of the collections due to the Concord and other upper and connecting roads, and has made monthly settlements with said roads therefor.\n\n14. Both these contracting parties have for years employed a cashier chargeable with the duty of collecting from the ticket-sellers, freight agents, and various other receivers of corporate funds, and of paying the properly approved bills of the corporations, making monthly settlements with the treasurers for the sums so received and paid. This is the usual and judicious course pursued by large railroad corporations; and the cashier appointed under this contract performs for each of these corporations precisely the same duties heretofore performed by the cashier of each, and gives bonds for the faithful performance thereof.\n\n15. The division of the common earnings under this contract is based upon and determined by the earning capacity, past experience, and existing circumstances of the two corporations. Under it each of said corporations receives its just share of said common earnings, and of the benefits resulting from the saving of expenses, and from the connecting use of the rolling stock and other property. Under this contract the Concord Railroad is entitled to and does receive a larger sum in net earnings than it would receive upon the same business under preceding contracts, and the public receive the benefit of cheaper rates and a more convenient and more efficient management. Under it the rights of the stockholders of the Concord Railroad are more fully protected and the rights of the public better subserved than they have ever been under any preceding contract, or can be under any arrangement which does not substantially embody its provisions.\n\n16. The present contract is practically identical with that under which the Boston  Lowell and Nashua  Lowell railroad corporations\nwere operated from 1857 to 1879, &#8212; the legality and expediency of which were not questioned, &#8212; said corporations being connecting railroads, forming part of the same line with the roads which are parties to the present contract.\n\nBingham  Mitchell, for the plaintiffs. The sixteen propositions presented by the defendants do not state a defence in law, and evidence in support of them is, upon the motion for an injunction, immaterial and irrelevant, and should be excluded. Carefully analyzed, their propositions resolve themselves into the following: &#8212;\n\nFirst. The object of the contract is \"to insure honesty, efficiency, and economy in the management of the contracting roads.\"\n\nSecond. It is beneficial to the Concord Railroad Corporation and its stockholders, because under it \"the Concord Railroad is entitled to, and does receive, a larger sum in net earnings than it would receive upon the same business under preceding contracts.\"\n\nThird. \"The public receive the benefit of cheaper rates, and a more convenient and more efficient management.\"\n\nFourth. \"The great mass of the business of the Concord Railroad is connecting business with the Boston  Lowell Railroad, and commerce between the states.\"\n\nFifth. \"The present contract is practically identical with\" other contracts made, performed, and tolerated between connecting roads, \"the legality and expediency of which were never questioned.\"\n\nThe defendants do not contend that the contract is authorized by an express grant of corporate power. An incidental power is one that is directly and immediately appropriate to the execution of the specific power granted, and not one that has a slight or remote relation to it. Hood v. N.Y.  N.H. R. R.,  22 Conn. 16 ; Curtis v. Leavitt,  15 N.Y. 157 ; Buffett v. T.  B. R. R.,  40 N.Y. 176 ; Beaty v. Knowler, 4 Pet. 152 Potter Corp. 652; Pierce Railroads 515; and authorities cited in former brief. The power which the directors attempted to exercise is not made an incidental one by the fact that their object was \"to insure honesty, efficiency, and economy in the management of the\" affairs of the Concord Railroad. To them the stockholders intrusted the management of the Concord road, from Concord to Nashua, with its leased lines. This trust was committed to the directors to be personally administered by them, and not to be delegated to others. If they could not discharge this trust honestly, efficiently, and economically, they were bound to surrender it to their masters, the stockholders, instead of delegating it to strangers. Their authority was limited. To them was committed, not the management of the affairs of a road from Concord to Boston, but simply from Concord to Nashua. They were agents or trustees of the stockholders, and in what they did beyond the limit of their\nauthority they were not agents or trustees of the stockholders, and could not bind them. Their propositions do not assert that the contract was necessary \"to insure honesty, efficiency, and economy in the management of the\" Concord road.\n\nIt is immaterial whether the net income is increased or diminished by the operation of the contract. If the directors had authority to make it, it is valid, even though it largely reduced the income. If they had not authority, it matters not if it double or quadruple the income. The question is one of power, wholly regardless of the beneficial or injurious effects of its exercise. Davis v. Old Colony R. R. Co.,  131 Mass. 258 . The profit resulting from the operation of a contract made by an agent can never be a legal test of his authority to make it. And public benefit can never be secured through a corporate contract not authorized by the charter. The Concord Railroad Corporation is not empowered to allow others to run its road, either alone, or jointly with itself. Thomas v. Railroad, 101 U.S. 83 ; Pierce Railroads 514.\n\nGen. Laws, c. 159, s. 2, and c. 164, s. 10, are not repugnant to the constitution or laws of the United States in relation to interstate commerce. Veazie v. Moor, 14 How. 568; State Tax Case, 15 Wall. 284; Munn v. Illinois,  94 U.S. 113 ; Railway v. Iowa,  94 U.S. 155 ; Peik v. Chicago \nN. W; R'y,  94 U.S. 164 . The three latter cases were decided ten years after the passage of the federal statute on which the defendants rely as bringing this contract within the regulation of inter-state commerce. If that statute releases the Concord Railroad from obedience to the laws of New Hampshire, on the ground that some of its business is the transportation of freight and passengers bound from one state to another, it releases every railroad corporation created by the legislature. They are all engaged in the same kind of business, and each \"constitutes a part of a line of railroads extending through several states.\" The result of their release would be that New Hampshire can create corporations, but cannot govern them; and a person who purchased stock in a road running from Concord to Nashua might awake to find his servants had made him a stockholder in a road running from Quebec to San Francisco. He might further discover that although the road in which he bought stock paid ten per cent. annual dividends, the road in which his servants placed him would pay nothing.

Spalding, one hundred and six shares; &#8212; and they make this complaint as well in behalf of all other stockholders in said Concord Railroad, except the defendants, as in behalf of themselves\n\nThat the railroad of said defendants, the Concord Railroad Corporation, is thirty-five miles in length, and for a long time has been, still is, and of necessity must continue to be, a necessary and natural outlet for the traffic of the said Northern and Boston, Concord  Montreal railroads and their respective branches, and by reason thereof the said Concord Railroad, up to the time of the acts done and agreement and contract made and entered into by the defendants, as hereinafter complained of, had earned large sums from said traffic, and from which ought to have inured good profits to its stockholders;\n\nThat said defendants, or some of them, as the plaintiffs are informed and believe, have but little direct pecuniary interest in the stock or successful operation of said Concord Railroad, while all or nearly all of them have large interests in the stock, successful operation, and profits of other and rival railroads, viz., the said Boston  Lowell, Boston, Concord  Montreal, and Northern railroads, the interests of which are adverse to the interests of said Concord Railroad and its stockholders, and they, said defendants, were elected or declared to be elected directors of said Concord Railroad, at its last annual\nmeeting, on account of their known interest in and partiality to said other and rival railroads, whose interests were and are adverse to the interests of said Concord Railroad and its stockholders as aforesaid;\n\nThat the said defendants, Smyth, Bell, Vose, Johnson, Sherburne, Kimball, and Hayes, holding and representing interests adverse to said Concord Railroad and its stockholders, and contriving and designing to protect, improve, and enhance in value and increase the profits of said adverse interests, and contriving and designing, as said plaintiffs believe, to injure said Concord Railroad and its stockholders, and to decrease its and their legitimate profits and depreciate the value of its stock, and to give to other railroads, and those having adverse interests, the benefits and profits derived from its advantageous location, and without the consent of the stockholders, and in direct violation of the public law of New Hampshire and the charter and by-laws of said Concord Railroad, did, on August 19, 1881, in the name of said Concord Railroad, make and enter into a contract with the said Boston  Lowell Railroad, which is a foreign corporation, the terms, stipulations, and provisions of which contract are injurious to the interests and destructive of the rights and property of the Concord Railroad, and are unwarranted by the public law of said state of New Hampshire and the charter of said Concord Railroad, and, if permitted to be carried out, must, as the plaintiffs believe, result in the material decrease of the profits and the depreciation in value of said Concord Railroad, and therefore work great injury to the rights, property, and interests of the stockholders of said Concord Railroad;\n\nThat said defendants, Bell, Smyth, Vose, Johnson, Kimball, Sherburne, and Hayes, assuming to act as directors of said Concord Railroad, authorized, or attempted to authorize, the said defendant, J. Thomas Vose, to sign and seal said contract by a vote passed August 19, 1881, a copy of which is as follows:\n\n\"On motion, voted, that the president of this corporation be authorized to affix the corporate name and seal to the agreement with the Boston \nLowell Railroad for a joint operation of the two railroads for five years from September 1, 1881.\"\n\nAnd said defendant, J. Thomas Vose, did sign and seal said contract, a copy of which is hereunto annexed, marked \"A;\"\n\nThat said contract contemplates and provides for the transfer of \"the entire control\" of said Concord Railroad and its \"shops, depots, furniture, rolling-stock, machinery, tools,\" and its other property used in its operation, from its directors to \"a general manager, who shall be chosen by the concurrent vote of a majority of the directors of each party,\" which is a management and delegation of authority which are neither recognized in or authorized by the charter of said Concord Railroad, which was granted by the legislature of New Hampshire, June 27, 1835; because section two of said charter provides that \"the immediate government and\ndirection of the affairs of the said corporation shall be vested in seven directors,\" chosen by the corporation annually, and not in an authority selected by a foreign corporation, as provided for by said contract in articles two and nine;\n\nThat under said contract \"the care and custody of the finances\" of said Concord Railroad are \"to be confided to a cashier,\" in the choice of which said foreign corporation participates, and who is, or is to be, as the plaintiffs are informed and believe, a citizen of the commonwealth of Massachusetts, and therefore beyond the jurisdiction both of the courts and legislature of New Hampshire, and who is also, as the plaintiffs are informed and believe, a stockholder in and an officer of said foreign corporation, while said section two of said charter provides for \"a treasurer, who shall give bonds to the corporation with sureties, to the satisfaction of the directors, in a sum not less than twenty thousand dollars, for the faithful discharge of his trust;\" and article seven of the by-laws of said corporation, adopted July 7, 1841, defines the duties of the treasurer of said corporation as follows:\n\n\"The bond of the treasurer shall be for a sum not less than thirty thousand dollars, and be in the custody of the president. It shall be the duty of the treasurer to collect all installments, safely to keep the seal of the corporation, and all the moneys, securities, and valuable papers; to disburse and deliver over the same as the directors shall require; keep his books and accounts in an approved form, showing the true condition of the finances and funds of the corporation\";\n\nThat, notwithstanding these provisions of the charter and bylaws of the Concord Railroad, the defendants have transferred and are transferring all the moneys and earnings of said Concord Railroad from the hands and possession of the treasurer, agents, servants, and employes of said Concord Railroad to the possession and custody and into the control of said cashier, who is a citizen of Massachusetts and beyond the control and jurisdiction of the courts and legislature of New Hampshire, to the great injury and prejudice to the rights of said stockholders, and in direct violation of said charter and by-laws and the public laws of said state of New Hampshire, and also in violation and disregard of a perpetual injunction made by the circuit court of New Hampshire at its October term, 1875, for Merrimack county aforesaid;\n\nThat under article nine of said contract, the \"general manager,\" who is to be \"chosen by the concurrent vote of a majority of the directors of each party,\" \"may be removed\" by the unanimous vote of the directors of said foreign corporation, and so said Concord Railroad directors cannot prevent it, even if they desired it, and the interests of the Concord Railroad and its stockholders required it, and thus the immediate direction of the affairs of said Concord Railroad Corporation, which, by said section two of said charter of said Concord Railroad, are\nvested in seven directors chosen by the members of said Concord Railroad, is, by said article nine of said contract, taken from them and committed to the control of the directors of said foreign corporation, in direct violation of the charter of said Concord Railroad as prescribed in section two, and in violation of the public law of said state of New Hampshire, and which must result, if permitted to continue, in the great and irreparable injury to the rights, interests, and property of the stockholders of said Concord Railroad, by placing its control and management in the hands of the directors of a foreign corporation, whose interests are adverse to the interests of said Concord Railroad and its stockholders;\n\nThat the \"cashier,\" to whom the \"care and custody of the finances\" of said Concord Railroad are committed by article ten of said contract, may be removed without the consent of the Concord Railroad or its directors, providing his removal is desired and voted by all the directors of said Boston  Lowell Railroad, which would result in the change of the custodian of the funds of said Concord Railroad without the consent of the directors or stockholders, which is, as the plaintiffs believe, a clear violation and perversion of section two of the charter of said Concord Railroad and article seven of the by-laws thereof and of the public law of the state of New Hampshire, and injurious to the rights and interests of the Concord Railroad and its stockholders;\n\nThat under said contract said Concord Railroad is deprived of the right and privilege of making any changes in the local or through rates for transportation over its road as they existed on said August 19, 1881, except with the approval of said foreign corporation, that is to say, as stated in article eleven of said contract, \"without the approval of the directors of the local road so interested and the joint management,\" &#8212; thus in this particular, too, taking from said Concord Railroad directors the \"immediate government and direction of the affairs of said corporation\" and putting them into the control of a foreign corporation and its directors;\n\nThat, by article twenty-five of said contract all matters of disagreement under the contract are to be \"referred to the arbitration of three persons,\" &#8212; Francis B. Hayes, one of said defendants, on the part of said Concord road; T. Jefferson Coolidge, on the part of the Boston  Lowell road; and a third to be chosen by these two, &#8212; and the \"decision of a majority of whom shall in all cases be final and conclusive\";\n\nThat said Hayes is selected to represent said Concord Railroad in said arbitration, although he has but merely a nominal interest, if any, in said Concord Railroad, while he has large interests, as the plaintiffs are informed and believe, in other and rival roads whose interests are adverse to the Concord Railroad, viz., the Northern in New Hampshire, and others in Massachusetts; and so in said arbitration the interests of the said Concord Railroad\nwould be intrusted to a party who is not impartial or interested for the Concord road, but who is directly interested adversely to it and its stockholders; &#8212; and consequently, as your complainants believe, no just and impartial adjustment of any differences in which the Concord road might be interested with the Boston  Lowell road could be had or expected, so far as the rights and interests of the Concord road were concerned;\n\nThat, by article six of said contract, additional leases or contracts for the operation of connecting railroads may be made by either party, if sanctioned and approved by both parties, which permits the Boston \nLowell Railroad and the directors of the Concord road, who are interested adversely, as hereinbefore stated, to lease roads to the Concord road in which they are interested, and pay a rent or income to such roads from such leases that would be greatly to the advantage of such roads, and much in excess of their real earnings, and without reference to the interests of the Concord road, and therefore by this means transfer and turn over to such other roads a portion of the profits and income of the Concord road, which of right belong wholly to the stockholders of said Concord road, and which should not be denied them; and such leases and contracts as are contemplated by this article of said contract are in violation of the charter of said Concord Railroad hereinbefore referred to, and in violation of the public law of New Hampshire;\n\nThat under said contract, said joint management must pay to said Boston  Lowell Railroad, for the use of the Massachusetts Central Railroad, twenty-five per cent. of its gross receipts, and pay the interest on the cost of the equipment of said Massachusetts Central road; and upon the termination of said contract, said joint management is to make an allowance for any depreciation, from use, of the said equipment, and this, too, without any reference whatever to the net earnings of said Massachusetts Central Railroad, so that even though its gross earnings are not sufficient to pay the cost of running it, said Concord Railroad must contribute to an income to the Boston  Lowell road for it, even though nothing is obtained from it;\n\nThat said plaintiffs further allege that said contract is in all respects, as well those not hereinbefore referred to as those to which they have referred, in violation of and unauthorized by the public law of New Hampshire and the charter of said Concord Railroad, as hereinbefore referred to, and must be, if permitted to be carried on, very injurious in its effects upon the rights and privileges of said Concord Railroad, and injuriously affect the value of its stock owned and held by its stockholders, and is a scheme and conspiracy entered into by said defendants for the purpose of taking a part of the earnings, profits, and advantages of said Concord Railroad from its stockholders, and giving them to said Boston  Lowell, Northern, and Boston, Concord  Montreal\nrailroads, and thereby rob said Concord Railroad of some of its legitimate earnings and profits, and also thereby decrease its income and depreciate the market value of its stock.\n\nWherefore said plaintiffs pray that said defendants, and their agents, servants, attorneys, and employes, may be forever enjoined from operating or in any manner meddling with the management of said Concord Railroad under said contract in any way; and that said directors of said Concord Railroad be required and ordered to resume the control and management of said Concord Railroad, in accordance with the provisions of its charter as hereinbefore set forth, and in accordance with the laws of the state of New Hampshire; and that in the meantime a receiver may be appointed to take charge of the management of said Concord Railroad pending litigation on this bill, or that the directors of said Concord Railroad be required and ordered to resume the control and management of said Concord Railroad during the pendency of such litigation, and for such other further or different relief as to said court may seem just.\n\n                 Edmund Burke,         Edward L.

Copeland.\n\n\"A\"\n\nContract between the Boston  Lowell Railroad Corporation and the Concord Railroad Corporation.\n\nThis memorandum of agreement, made this nineteenth day of August, in the year eighteen hundred and eighty-one, between the Boston  Lowell Railroad Corporation, a corporation duly established by the laws of the commonwealth of Massachusetts, of the first part, and the Concord Railroad Corporation, a corporation duly established by the laws of the state of New Hampshire, of the second part, &#8212;\n\nWitnesseth, That whereas a large portion of the business of the roads of the parties hereto is a joint business, passing over the roads and through the hands of both parties, making desirable a common policy and unanimity of management; and whereas, in the transaction of said business there is a mutual interest in said parties, both as to the mode of transaction and as to the tariff upon the same, as well as in all other matters relating thereto; and whereas, said corporations, by operating said roads in common management, would thereby be enabled to do the said business with greater facility and regularity, and at a greater saving of\nexpense to both parties: Now, therefore, for the promotion of their mutual interest through a more efficient and more economical joint operation and management of the said roads, and for the better security of their respective investments as well as for the convenience and interest of the public, the said parties do hereby covenant and agree to and with each other, that for the term of five years from and after the first day of September, eighteen hundred and eighty-one, the Boston  Lowell Railroad and the Concord Railroad, including all branches, leased roads, and all roads operated and controlled by them, shall be worked and managed as one road, under the stipulations and conditions, and subject to the exceptions and limitations, as set forth in the following articles:\n\nARTICLE I. This indenture shall be construed as a business contract only, and in no sense as a lease of one road to the other, or as a union of their corporate powers or privileges, each party retaining to itself all of its chartered rights and liabilities, and the power to sue or liability to be sued, in its own separate name and capacity, in the same manner and to the same extent as heretofore, excepting that in so far as between these parties the rights and liabilities of one with the other shall be settled and determined by this agreement.\n\nART. II. The joint management herein provided for shall have, to be used in accordance with the provisions of this contract the entire control of the roads of each party, their shops, depots furniture, rolling-stock, machinery, tools, and other property necessary for the maintenance and working of the joint roads; also all lands and buildings, for whatever purposes used, within or without the location of the roads of each party, and others owned, leased, or operated by them; reserving only to the separate management such other property of each corporation as has been accumulated.\n\nART. III. All leases and contracts now existing with either of the corporations parties hereto as hereinafter stated, together with those for transportation, shall be assumed and carried out by these joint parties, and the receipts from the same during the continuance of this contract put into the joint income.\n\nART. IV. There shall be allowed from the joint earnings the following sums as rentals of roads so long as the same shall be operated and managed by the parties hereto during the continuance of this agreement, viz., &#8212;\n\nTo the Boston  Lowell Railroad, on account of Massachusetts Central Railroad, 25 per cent. of its gross receipts under its lease.\n\nMiddlesex Central Railroad, $15,000 per year, and 6 per cent. on cost of present extension.\n\nEastern Railroad, $4,800 per year.\n\nBoston  Maine Railroad, $3,000 per year.\n\nNashua  Lowell Railroad, $65,000 per year.\n\nWilton Railroad, $14,130 per year.\n\nPeterborough Railroad, 6 per cent. on cost of road, taxes, and $150 per year for organization expenses\n\nStony Brook Railroad, 6 per cent. on capital stock, taxes, and $300 per year for organization expenses.\n\nTo the Concord Railroad, on account of Manchester  Lawrence Railroad, $100,000 per year, and $1,600 for organization expenses.\n\nMethuen Branch, $11,000 per year.\n\nConcord  Portsmouth Railroad, $25,000 per year.\n\nSuncook Valley Railroad, $14,550 per year, and $300 for organization expenses, and 6 per cent. upon the cost of the extension of the road from Suncook to Hooksett, according to the terms of the lease, whenever such extension shall be made.\n\nNashua, Acton  Boston Railroad, $11,000 per year, and $200 for organization expenses.\n\nART. V. Renewals of existing leases, or modifications of the same, may be made during the continuance of this agreement, provided the liabilities of the joint roads are not increased without the consent of both the corporations parties hereto, and any reductions that may be made in the above rentals shall accrue to the lessee of the road making such reduction.\n\nART[.] VI. Such additional leases or contracts for the operation of connecting railroads may be made by either of the corporations parties hereto as may be deemed expedient; but no lease or contract so made shall impose any liability upon, or reduce the amount of, the joint income, unless the same shall be sanctioned and approved by both parties.\n\nART. VII. All contracts for supplies necessary for the operation and maintenance of the roads heretofore made by either party shall be assumed by the joint parties hereto and settled from the joint funds.\n\nART. VIII. Each party shall be separately liable for unsettled claims against it to the commencement of this agreement; but all liabilities growing out of or arising under this contract, and not specially excepted herein, shall be a charge upon the joint income.\n\nART. IX. The joint roads shall be operated and managed by a general manager, who shall be chosen by the concurrent vote of a majority of the directors of each party, and may be removed in like manner, or by the unanimous vote of either board; and the respective boards of directors shall, by such concurrent action, exercise the same control over the management as is usual with boards of railroad directors in ordinary cases.\n\nART. X. The care and custody of the finances of the joint management shall be confided to a cashier, who shall be chosen by the concurrent vote of a majority of the directors of each party, and may be removed in like manner or by the unanimous vote of either board; said cashier to give such suitable bond for the performance\nof his trust as may be prescribed by the directors of each corporation.\n\nART. XI. No changes in the present local or through rates for transportation shall be made without the approval of the directors of the local road so interested, and the joint management.\n\nART. XII. The cars, engines, furniture, with stationary engines, tools in machine-shops, and for road repairs, shall be accurately inventoried and appraised by persons mutually agreed upon for this purpose, and be kept in equal comparative repair to their present state and condition; and any additions to the same, beyond what is necessary to cover depreciation, made during the continuance of the contract, shall belong to the respective parties in the same proportion as hereinafter agreed upon for the division of the joint income.\n\nART. XIII. The Boston  Lowell Railroad shall furnish and pay for the additional equipment required for the operation of the Massachusetts Central Railroad; and the interest on the cost of the same shall be paid from the joint funds. This equipment shall be kept by the joint management in good repair, and be at all times during the continuance of this agreement at the risk, from all causes, of the joint management; and upon the termination of this contract the joint roads shall make a proper allowance for any depreciation from use.\n\nART. XIV. A full inventory and appraisal shall also be made, by persons mutually agreed upon for this purpose, of all stock in the machine-shops, and for road repairs, coal, wood, oil, waste, rails, ties, and all operating materials on hand and owned by each separate party at the commencement of this contract; and the amount of such appraisal shall be charged to the current joint account, crediting to the respective parties the portion put by each into the common stock; &#8212; and on the termination of this contract all such stock and materials as shall remain in the hands of the joint management, together with any additions that may have been made thereto during the continuance of the same, shall be appraised, and the amount returned to each party that it contributed at the commencement of this agreement, any excess or deficiency from said amount to be shared by the joint roads in the same proportion as hereinafter agreed upon for the division of the joint income.\n\nART. XV. The road-bed, bridges, superstructure, depots, buildings, wharves, fixtures, and other property of each road shall be kept as near as may be in like relative repair to their present state and condition; and all casualties and damages to the same shall be at the common risk, and charged in the current joint account, except damage by fire as hereinafter provided for.\n\nART. XVI. The joint management shall provide proper insurance upon the bridges, depots, buildings, wharves, fixtures, and other property of the roads committed to its charge, payable to\nthe owners of the property, unless otherwise specially ordered; and in case of destruction or damage to any bridges, depots, buildings, and fixtures, so insured, by fire, the party owning or leasing the same shall proceed at once, at its own separate cost, to rebuild or replace said structure, or such substitute therefor as the wants of the joint business may require: Provided, such party shall not, at its separate cost, be compelled to erect a more expensive structure in any case than the one injured or destroyed.\n\nART. XVII. The expense of all permanent improvements shall be borne by the road upon which said improvements shall be made; and when said improvements shall have been authorized and approved by both boards of directors, the interest on the same shall be reckoned as expense, and be a charge upon the joint funds. No expense in the nature of a permanent improvement shall be made by the general manager upon the roads of either of the parties hereto without the consent of the directors of the road so interested.\n\nART. XVIII. Each road may, at its own expense, at any time, employ competent persons to examine the property in charge of the joint management; and any deficiency or depreciation reported from such examination shall, upon notice to the general manager, be made good, by forthwith putting the property in proper condition, or by an equivalent cash payment from the joint funds: Provided, however, if the other party to this contract is dissatisfied with the finding of the said examiner so appointed, the questions in dispute shall be referred to the arbitrators as hereinafter provided.\n\nART. XIX. All taxes assessed upon the capital stock of the joint roads and roads leased and operated by them, and the property committed to the joint management, shall be considered an ordinary expense, and charged to the operating accounts of the joint roads.\n\nART. XX. The insurance premiums paid by either party on unexpired policies, for risks upon the property of the joint roads, shall be apportioned in such manner as to become a common charge from and after the commencement of this agreement, each party paying its own premium for the portion of time up to the said date, and charging to the joint account the unexpired portion; and the same apportionment shall be made of any and all payments for rents made by either party for a time extending beyond this date and inuring to the common benefit.\n\nART. XXI. All expenses of the organization of the roads parties hereto shall be paid from the separate fund of each, and not from the common fund.\n\nART. XXII. The net income, after payment of all expenses incident to the operation of the joint roads, including rentals as aforesaid, shall be divided between said corporations in the proportion of 60 per cent. to the Boston  Lowell Railroad, and 40 per cent. to the Concord Railroad.\n\nART. XXIII. All prepayments to either party on transportation account for season and package tickets, or any other prepaid income, shall be apportioned as above, and each party shall be charged for the benefit of the joint account, with their collections, on such unexpired portion of said prepayments.\n\nART. XXIV. As soon as possible after the close of each month, the income and expense accounts of the joint roads shall be made up, as nearly as may be, and the net balance appearing shall be divided upon the general basis of division hereinbefore stated, and paid over on account to each corporation respectively, subject to a final adjustment at the semi-annual closing of the accounts, which shall occur upon the last days of March and September in each year, inclusive.\n\nART. XXV. All matters of disagreement under this contract shall be referred to the arbitration of three persons, &#8212; Francis B. Hayes on the part of the Concord Railroad, and T. Jefferson Coolidge on the part of the Boston  Lowell Railroad, these two to choose a third, &#8212; the decision of a majority of whom shall in all cases be final and conclusive. If a vacancy shall occur on the part of either party, it shall be filled by the board of directors of said party.\n\nART. XXVI. This agreement shall take effect as of September 1, 1881, and continue in full force for the term of five years from that date.\n\nIn witness whereof, the said parties have caused their corporate seals to be hereto affixed, and this instrument to be signed by their respective presidents thereto duly authorized, the day and year first above written.\n\n                       The Boston  Lowell Railroad Corporation, [SEAL]                               By J. G. Abbott, President. Concord Railroad Corporation, [SEAL]                            By J. Thomas Vose, President. \n\nSigned, sealed, and delivered in presence of\n\n   C. Ed. Bartlett, to J. G. A. Edward D. Harlow,  } } to J. T. V. Emil A. Danielson, } \n\nOctober 8, 1881, the plaintiffs presented to one of the justices the bill in equity which had not been served or filed, and a written application for a temporary injunction to restrain the defendants from operating or meddling with the management of the Concord Railroad under the alleged contract, while the rights of the plaintiffs are being determined on the bill, and to suspend the operation of the contract during litigation. No notice having been given, the plaintiffs were authorized to give notice of a hearing to be had at the office of their counsel in Concord as soon as they pleased. October 10, the plaintiffs gave the Concord Railroad and some of its officers notice of a hearing to be had October 11. On the latter day those defendants who had been notified appeared; and the\nBoston  Lowell Railroad appeared without service of notice. The plaintiffs offered to prove that they were stockholders of the Concord Railroad, and that the alleged contract had been made; and moved that their application for an injunction be granted without any inquiry into any other matters of fact, &#8212; contending that, as matter of law, the contract having been made, the plaintiffs, being stockholders, were entitled to the injunction asked, because the contract was beyond the corporate power of the Concord Railroad, and would be invalid even if made in good faith and if beneficial to the plaintiffs. The defendants contended, that without proof of any actual damage done or likely to be done to the plaintiffs' interests, equity would not give the plaintiffs the injunction they asked, before their charges of a fraudulent conspiracy were proved or abandoned, before the legal rights of the parties were settled by a decision of the court on the merits, and before the facts were proved which would be material to be considered on the questions of law.\n\nThe justice proposed that, by agreement, the case be entered at the October trial term, &#8212; all disputed facts to be found by a referee before the next law term (to be held December 6), &#8212; and a case to be reserved, as of the October term, for argument at the December term. To this proposition the defendants assented. The plaintiffs objected on the ground that the trial would be protracted beyond the December term at great and unnecessary expense, and that, upon the undisputed facts of the making of the contract and the plaintiffs' ownership of Concord Railroad stock, the case must necessarily be decided in their favor. The justice being of opinion that the injunction ought not to be issued by one member of the court on the ground taken in the plaintiffs' motion, the plaintiffs desired that a course be taken by which their application and motion might be heard by the whole court in December. The defendants objected, on the ground that such a course would cause unnecessary delay, as the case could not be properly decided or heard at the law term without proof of other facts than the making of the contract and the plaintiffs' ownership of Concord Railroad stock, and, before December, there could be and ought to be a finding of the facts upon which the questions of law should be submitted to the court at the December term. At the plaintiffs' request, their application and motion were adjourned to December 6, 1881, for the purpose of giving them an opportunity to present the same to the whole court.\n\nThe parties to the alleged contract had entered upon its performance in accordance with its terms, and were performing it when the application for an injunction was made.", "procedural_history": "", "scdb_id": "", "sibling_ids": [3554702], "source": "ZU", "status": "Published", "suitNature": "", "syllabus": ""}
{"absolute_url": "/opinion/3571772/connecticut-river-lumber-co-v-olcott-falls-co/", "attorney": "Aldrich  Remich and Drew  Jordan, for the plaintiffs. I. The Connecticut river is by nature a public highway. Scott v. Willson, 3 N.H. 321 ; Thompson v. Co.,  64 N.H. 548 ; Barnes v. Heath (unpublished opinion); Gould Waters, ss. 107-109; Ang. High., ss. 55, 56, 67-72.\n\nRecognizing the public character of its waters, the legislature provided (s. 19, c. 135, G. L.) that no owner or occupier of any mill-dam or water-power shall acquire by prescription any right against the state or the public to impede or in any way injure navigation, etc., in any of the waters of the state. For the purpose of showing the policy of the state with reference to the rights of the public in its navigable waters, we would call attention to s. 15 of c. 141, Gen. Laws, which provides that any person or corporation, authorized by its charter so to do, may erect and maintain dams upon and across any stream not navigable &#8212; thus placing a negative upon any supposed claim or authority to obstruct navigable waters.\n\nAgain: By s. 19 of the same chapter, it is expressly provided that the provisions of the mill act authorizing the construction of dams \"shall not be applicable to any navigable waters in this state.\" The legislature has repeatedly protected its water highways by negatives of the character cited, and has thereby indicated its policy to preserve the rights of the public therein for the purposes of commerce and navigation. We shall claim, further on, that the policy so declared has an important bearing against the defendants' position as to the construction of the act of 1848.\n\nII. The Connecticut river being a natural public highway, the individual or private rights along its banks are \"held subject to the risks (and uses) incident to the exercise of the public right.\" In other words, property near a water highway is subject to the paramount right of passage of the public. Thompson v. Co.,  54 N.H. 558 ; Barnes v. Heath (unpublished opinion); Knox v. Chaloner,  42 Me. 150 ; Treat v. Lord,  42 Me. 552 ; Dwinel v. Veazie,  44 Me. 167 ; Parks v. Morse,  52 Me. 260 ; Lancey v. Clifford, 54 Me. 487 ; Veazie v. Dwinel,  50 Me. 479 .\n\nThe Massachusetts cases hold the same principle. Stoughton v. Baker, 4 Mass. 522 ; Commonwealth v. Alger, 7 Cush. 100; Commonwealth v. Essex Co., 13 Gray 248. The owner of a mill-dam on such a river is bound to provide a suitable and reasonably convenient passage-way for commerce; and if he fails to do so his dam becomes a nuisance, and may be abated by any member of the public having occasion to use the same. Dwinel v. Veazie,  44 Me. 167 ; Parks v. Morse, supra; Lancey v. Clifford, supra; Wood Nuis., s. 756, p. 858 &#8212; also ss. 483, 484, 753, 757-762.\n\nIII. The bill alleges the public character of the river &#8212; that the plaintiffs have occasion to use the same for the purpose of passing their property to the markets of other states; that the defendants' dam, which was in process of construction at the time of the filing of the bill, when completed, would be an obstruction; that at the time of the hearing the dam had been completed, and was an obstruction which, if maintained, would absolutely prevent the passage of logs, ruin the plaintiffs' business enterprise, and cause irreparable injury and interminable litigation. The defendants, by their demurrer, say that the bill shows no ground for relief, and for one special cause of demurrer, say that the right infringed is a public right and the grievance a public nuisance; and that, by the laws of the land, courts of equity will not interfere at the instance of a private person. English courts of equity, from a very early day, have granted relief at the instance of private individuals, who were suffering special injury from the maintenance of a public nuisance. While the jurisdiction of the court of equity in New Hampshire may not be coextensive with that of the English court of chancery, yet, as to all subjects over which jurisdiction has been expressly conferred, as well as all subjects cognizable in equity, during the colonial period, its powers and jurisdiction are identical with those of the English court of chancery, and of the American courts having general equity powers. In other words, as to all matters within its scope, its jurisdiction includes all the incidental and auxiliary details, powers; and remedies belonging to the general system of equity jurisprudence as used in the administration of justice according to the methods and usages of equity. See 1 Pom. Eq., s. 299.\n\nWe maintain that the New Hampshire courts of equity have jurisdiction of matters of nuisance independent of the statute; but whether this be true or not, in one sense, becomes immaterial in view of the fact that the legislature, in the revision of 1867, expressly conferred, upon courts of equity, jurisdiction over the subjects of nuisance and waste. When jurisdiction was conferred upon courts of equity to deal with matters of nuisance, power to deal with the subject according to the course of justice and equity, as administered by courts having general equity powers, attached as a matter of course. And when it comes to the question as to what relief shall be granted, we suppose that our courts will follow the\nprecedents of courts of equity, which have dealt with such subjects in the past. Courts of equity will interfere to restrain and prevent threatened public nuisances at the suit of a private person who may suffer a special injury thereby, as well as to abate those already existing.

Loeb, 7 Robt. 418; Railroad v. Shiels,  33 Ga. 601 ; Knox v. Chaloner, 42 Me. 150 . The supreme court of New Hampshire has asserted its full equitable jurisdiction to restrain or abate nuisances in all cases where legal remedies are impracticable or inadequate. Pom. Eq., s. 308; Coe v. Co.,  37 N.H. 254 ; Webber v. Gage,  39 N.H. 182 ; Burnham v. Kempton,  44 N.H. 78 ,  79 ,  92 ; Eastman v. Co.,  47 N.H. 71 , 78 ; Bassett v. Co.,  47 N.H. 426 ,  437 .\n\nIn Coe v. Co. the demurrer was sustained upon the ground that the bill did not state a case, not for want of jurisdiction. Indeed the jurisdiction over such questions was distinctly asserted by the court in the following language: \"It is well settled that both public and private nuisances may, under some circumstances, fall within the jurisdiction of a court of equity, both with reference to obtaining redress for injuries already sustained, and relief from further molestation by the abatement of the nuisance.\"\n\nIn Webber v. Gage, the demurrer was overruled, on the ground that the allegations of the bill made a case for equitable interference. Of course (as said in Eastman v. Co.,  47 N.H. 71 ), to justify the interference of a court of equity there must be pressing necessity, imminent danger of great and irreparable damage, for which an action at law would not furnish an adequate, speedy, and practicable remedy. The bill in the case at bar presents an emergency clearly and imperatively demanding the interference of a court of equity. It will be observed that all of the foregoing New Hampshire cases were decided prior to the revision of 1867, which expressly conferred jurisdiction over nuisance and waste.\n\nIV. The question whether the bill presents ground for the interposition\nof a court of equity, is a question to be settled by the court at the trial term. Dole v. Pike,  64 N.H. 22 . Prior to 1867, jurisdiction over nuisances did not depend upon any statute, but was exercised as independent, original, and common-law jurisdiction. In such cases the right of trial by jury does not exist. Bellows v. Bellows,  58 N.H. 60 . See, also, opinion by Ladd, J. (Copp v. Henniker),  55 N.H. 210 , where he adopts the language of Judge Bell that \"Equity, as a great branch of the law of their native country, was brought over by the colonists, and has always existed as a part of the common law in its broadest sense in New Hampshire.\" It is very certain, if equity jurisdiction has always existed in its broadest sense in New Hampshire, that it has embraced the subject of nuisances; and it is equally certain, if such power existed as a part of the original jurisdiction of courts of chancery, that the right of trial by jury was not given by the constitution. Judge Ladd, id., 210, 211. There is every reason for holding that courts of equity should deal with a nuisance.\n\nIt is probably true, if the nuisance is of a public nature, that courts will not interfere upon the complaint of a private individual who has no interest except that in common with the general public, but will leave the matter to be regulated in a proceeding in the name of the prosecuting officer, or by indictment. But where the obstruction is peculiarly damaging to a party, he may abate upon the arbitrary power of self-protection, or he may resort to the summary power of a court of equity. The equity jurisdiction results from the necessity and peril of the situation. Speed is the essential element of the relief required. The reasons for the exercise of such powers by courts of equity are very well stated by Story, ss. 924, 926.\n\nV. An individual suffering special injury may abate the nuisance. He may have his remedy with or without the aid of the attorney-general. He may have it by bill and information joined, if necessary. Gould Waters, s. 121, n. 3, s. 128; Arundel v. M'Culloch,  10 Mass. 70 , Wood Nuis., ss. 794, 795, 800.\n\nVI. The amendment joining the attorney-general was a precautionary amendment, and made with a view of bringing the proceeding, if necessary, within the provisions of the act of 1885, p. 284; but we view it as entirely immaterial and unnecessary.\n\nVII. Where there is jurisdiction, there is always power to grant the necessary relief. The plaintiffs ask for an injunction against the defendants' maintaining a dam across the Connecticut river without providing suitable sluice-ways for the reasonable passage of timber. Such an injunction would be mandatory in character, but has been repeatedly granted by courts of equity. Pom. Eq., s. 1359, n. 2; Robinson v. Lord Byron, 1 Bro. Ch. 588; High In. (2d ed.), ss. 792-804, n. 2; Rankin v. Huskisson, 4 Sim. 13; Spencer v. Company, 8 Sim. 193; Penn. v. Bridge Co., 13 Howard 518; Lane v. Newdigate, 10 Ves. 193; Gould Waters, ss. 552-555.\nIn Penn. v. Bridge Co. the injunction was mandatory, and compelled the removal of a bridge. In Lane v. Newdigate, the injunction was against impeding navigation by suffering locks to remain out of repair. In Spencer v. Company the injunction was against continuing the existing condition of affairs.\n\nVIII. The defendants contend that under the act of 1848 they are authorized to construct and maintain all such works as are necessary and proper for their business, without any limitations or restrictions whatever; while the plaintiffs contend that the defendants are restricted to such works as are reasonable and proper with reference to the rights of the public in the river for purposes of interstate navigation and floatage and other uses. The construction claimed by the defendants would be contrary to the well defined policy of New Hampshire, as expressed by repeated acts of the legislature. A construction abridging a public right will not be given to a legislative act unless such intention is expressly and distinctly stated therein. No such intention is expressed in the act of 1848. The construction contended for is contrary to reason In Hooksett v. Company,  44 N.H. 106 , the defendants claimed a construction for the words \"necessary and proper for the carrying on of their said works\" similar to that claimed by the defendants here. The court held that the charter afforded the defendants no protection against a claim for damages. See, also, Treat v. Lord,  42 Me. 552 .\n\nIX. If the fair construction of the act of 1848 is such as the defendants claim, it presupposes the absolute control and obstruction of an interstate highway, and is therefore unconstitutional and inoperative. Gould Waters, ss. 32-67; Penn. v. Bridge Co., 13 How. 518; Welton v. Missouri, 91 U.S. 275 ; Mobile v. Kimball,  102 U.S. 691 ; Wood Nuis. 542, s. 476.\n\nX. The ownership of the Mills-Olcott charter is a material question. Olcott v. Banfill,  4 N.H. 545 ,  546 .\n\nJeremiah Smith (with whom was W. S. Ladd), for the defendants. We maintain that there was not, at the time of the adoption of our constitution, and is not now, any remedy by private suit in equity in a case like the present; that the only remedy was, and is, by a public proceeding in behalf of the state; that in such public proceeding there was at the time of the adoption of the constitution an unquestioned right of trial by jury; and that the legislature has not attempted to take away this right, and could not if it would. The plaintiff corporation is not now (whatever it maybe hereafter) in a position to maintain a private suit, either at law or equity, against the defendants. The question whether the bill could have been maintained as a preventive remedy to restrain the erection of the dam does not arise. The bill was not seasonably brought for that purpose. The dam was already completed. This is now, in effect, a bill to abate a completed structure, on the ground that it is a public nuisance.\n\nThe plaintiffs, at the time of filing the bill, could not have maintained an action at law. \"An action at law does not lie against the author of a public nuisance without proof of special damage, not merely anticipated, but actually received.\" Durfee, C. J. Bowden v. Lewis,  13 R. I. 189  &#8212; S.C., 43 Am. Rep. 21, 24. \". . . a distinction must be made between actual present damages and those which rest in contemplation. While, in a proper case, the former may be recovered in a private action, the latter cannot.\" Lyon, J., in Clark v. Company, 36 N.W. Rep. 326, 328. There was, at the time of filing the bill, no present actual damage to the plaintiffs; \"but only such as rested in contemplation, and such as was common to all similarly situated.\" \"In all these cases,\" said Erle, C. J., speaking of the early English cases, \"the plaintiff was exercising his right of way, and the defendants obstructed that exercise, and caused particular damage thereby directly and immediately to the plaintiff.\" 5 B.  Sm. 160. Not so here. The plaintiffs' logs had not been obstructed in their actual passage down the river. At the time of commencing this suit, the plaintiffs not only had suffered no damage, but apprehended no damage save the loss of a public right which they were privileged to enjoy only in common with the rest of the public. No private right of the plaintiffs' was infringed or in danger of being infringed. As riparian owners, the plaintiffs have a right of access from their land to the river; and this is not a right held in common with the rest of the public, for other members of the public have no access to or from the river at the particular place. Hence an obstruction in the river which cuts off the plaintiffs' access from their land to the river, infringes a private right of the plaintiffs'. See Rose v. Groves, 5 Kan.  Gr. 613. But when the plaintiffs have once passed from their land to the river with their logs, and have commenced to float them downstream, they are a traveller like the rest of the public, and are attempting to exercise a public right &#8212; the right of navigation &#8212; which they share in common with all other persons. Undoubtedly a riparian owner has, like every other citizen, the right of navigating the river as one of the public. \"This, however, is not a right coming to him qua owner or occupier of any lands on the bank; nor is it a right which, per se, he enjoys in a manner different from any other member of the public.\" Lord Cairns, Chancellor, in Lyon v. Company, L. R. 1, App. Cas. 662, 671. These plaintiff complain solely of injury to a public right, and the damage liable to be suffered by the plaintiffs differs only in degree, and not in kind, from that liable to be suffered by the rest of the community O'Brien v. Railroad,  17 Conn. 372 , 376 ; Seeley v. Bishop,  19 Conn. 128 ,  135 ; Harvard College v. Stearns, 15 Gray 1; Brayton v. Fall River,  113 Mass. 218 ; Blackwell v. Railroad, 122 Mass. 1 ; Houck v. Wachter,  34 Md. 265  &#8212; S.C., 6 Am. Rep. 332; San Jose Ranch Co. v. Brooks,  74 Cal. 463 ; Clark v. Company, Sup. Ct. Wis., Jan. 31, 1888, 36 N.W. Rep. 326; Chicago v. Association,, where it was held that no action lies to recover damages for the obstruction of a navigable stream by the building of a bridge across the same, whereby the owner of a parcel of land and a wharf above the bridge is prevented from coming to the wharf from the sea in vessels, although his wharf is the only one above the bridge used for business purposes, and he is thereby compelled to abandon the use of his wharf for such purposes, and to transport his goods by land at an enhanced expense.\n\nIn Dover v. Portsmouth Bridge,  17 N.H. 200 ,  215 ,  216 , the question was raised whether the town of Dover, as the owner of wharves, could maintain a bill in equity to abate a bridge erected across navigable water below the wharves, and alleged to obstruct navigation. The case was disposed of without an express decision on this point. But Parker, C. J., said, \". . . an individual could not maintain a bill for the abatement of a nuisance, even if the court has power to abate by injunction, unless he could allege some particular grievance beyond that sustained by the public generally . . . . As an owner of wharves, it does not appear that the plaintiffs sustained any injury by this bridge, other than such as is common to all other owners of property of that description affected by it; and it deserves consideration whether they sustained any such particular injury as entitles them to this mode of redress.\"\n\nWe comment briefly on some of the cases cited by the plaintiffs. In Corning v. Factory,  40 N.Y. 191 , the defendants had infringed on the private light of the plaintiff as a riparian proprietor, viz., the right to have a stream flow in its natural channel along (i. e., beside of) the plaintiff's land. See 204. In Lane v. Newdigate, 10 Ves. 192, the decree was made in enforcement of a contract between the parties; the defendant was restrained from doing acts contrary to his covenants in a lease to the plaintiff. In Georgetown v. Company, 12 Pet. 91, the bill was dismissed. So the bill was dismissed in Bigelow v. Company,  14 Conn. 565 ; and the general drift of the opinion in the latter case seems adverse to the present plaintiffs. In Frink v. Lawrence,  20 Conn. 117 , the defendants were about to entirely obstruct access by water to the north side of the plaintiff's wharf, and thereby infringe a private right. In Pennsylvania v. Company, 13 How. 518, 587, 588, we call attention to the dissenting opinion of Taney, C. J. We also note the fact, stated in the majority opinion (see 566), that there was then no remedy by indictment under the laws of the United States for such a public nuisance. As to the Wisconsin cases cited by the plaintiffs, see comments in the recent opinion of that court, 36 N.W. Rep. 326, 328. Even if the plaintiffs had averred such peculiar injury as would entitle them to maintain an action at law for damages (e.g., that their land was flowed by the dam), it would not follow\nthat they could maintain this bill in equity. The weight of New Hampshire authority, as we understand it, is decidedly against the maintenance of a bill in equity to restrain or abate an alleged nuisance, until after the right has first been established in a suit at law (where there would, of course, be a trial by jury upon all questions of fact). See Burnham v. Kempton,  44 N.H. 78 ,  94 ,  95 ,  97 ,  101 ; Eastman v. Company,  47 N.H. 71 , p. 78; Perkins v. Foye,  60 N.H. 496 ; &#8212; see, also, Parker v. Company, 2 Black 545, 552, 553.\n\nThe same doctrine is strongly sustained by the decisions of the English courts of equity, prior to recent legislation in that country. Thus, in Motley v. Downman, 3 Myl.  Cr. 1, 14 (a trade-mark case), Lord Cottenham said, &#8212; \"I can hardly conceive a case in which the court will at once interfere by injunction, and prevent a defendant from disputing a plaintiff's legal title.\" This is perhaps the remark referred to in 1 Hem. Miller, 574, as Lord Cottenham's well known dictum, `that there shall be no perpetual injunction without an action.'\" In White v. Cohen, 1 Drew. 312, 318, Kinderley, V. C., said, &#8212; \"It is not disputed that the court cannot permanently restrain acts alleged to be a nuisance, until a court of law has declared that they do constitute a nuisance.\" In Dewhirst v. Wrigley, Coop. Pr. Cas. 319, 327, Lord Cottenham said, &#8212; \". . . although it was right to continue the injunction, the Master of the Rolls ought, as in other cases where the court interposes its injunction to prevent nuisance, to have made provision for having the question between the parties tried at law.\" (The English practice has now been altered by the Statute of 25 and 26 Vict., ch. 52, known as \"Sir John Rolt's Act.\") We do not understand that this case comes within any of the exceptions mentioned in Burnham v. Kempton,  44 N.H. 78 . The dam is already built; but if it were not, the mischief threatened by its erection is not practically irremediable, like the permanent filling up of a river channel with rocks and earth. Nor is this a case of immediate danger to the health or safety of the community, such as the case of a slaughter-house or powder-house in a populous neighborhood. The damage liable to be caused by the destruction of the dam may be offset against the damage liable to be caused by its maintenance; and the damage to either party would seem susceptible of pecuniary compensation. Whether the dam in its present form constitutes an infringement of the public right of passage is a question of fact, as to which there is no admission to estop the defendants. The very utmost a court of equity could be expected to do, if the dam were still in the process of erection, would be to grant a temporary injunction, pending a jury trial. See Ingraham v. Dunnell, 5 Met. 118, 126, 127; Burnham v. Kempton,  44 N.H. 78 ,  97 .\n\n\"Where an injunction is granted without a trial at law, it is usually upon the principle of preserving the property until a trial at law can be had. Swayne, J., in 2 Black 552. See, also,\nWoodbury, J., 9 How. 28, 29. But in the present case the application for the injunction is not intended to be merely auxiliary to a proceeding at law. The entire and final remedy is sought in a court of equity. And, moreover, the alleged nuisance already exists in a completed form. These plaintiffs can hardly claim a more favorable rule than that laid down by the supreme court of Maine: \"When the alleged nuisance is prospective and threatened, a court of equity may interfere to prevent its being brought into existence. When what is claimed to be a nuisance already exists, the general rule is, that the fact that it is a nuisance must be established by a suit at common law before a court of equity will interfere to abate.\" Appleton, C. J., in Varney v. Pope,  60 Me. 192 ,  194 ,  195 .\n\nThe foregoing discussion as to the procedure in a case of a private suit in equity for a public nuisance is, however, entirely unnecessary in this case. The plaintiffs have no right to maintain such a suit; they have, at present, no private remedy at law or in equity. The only remedy against these defendants is by a public proceeding, in the name of the state or of the attorney-general; and in such proceeding, whether by indictment or by bill in equity, the defendants have a constitutional right of trial by jury.\n\nWhen, and in what cases, is there a right of trial by jury under the New Hampshire constitution of 1792? We are not obliged to rely on the constitutional guaranty of trial by jury in criminal cases. Bill of Rights, Art. 15. We may safely concede for the moment, that the public prosecution for an alleged public nuisance, though criminal in form, is civil in substance, and that, hence, the case falls under Art. 20, relating to trial by jury in civil cases, which reads as follows:\n\n\"Art. 20. In all controversies concerning property, and in all suits between two or more persons, except in cases in which it has been heretofore otherwise used and practised, and except in cases in which the value in controversy does not exceed one hundred dollars and title of real estate is not concerned, the parties have a right to trial by jury; and this method of procedure shall be held sacred, unless, in cases arising on the high seas and such as relate to mariners' wages, the legislature shall think it necessary hereafter to alter it.\"\n\nUnder this article, trial by jury is the rule, \"and trial without jury the exception.\" The burden of proof is on the plaintiffs, claiming the benefit of an exception, to bring the case fully within the exception. \"If the question is left in doubt, that doubt must be resolved in the defendant's favor.\" The exception of \"cases in which it has been heretofore otherwise used and practised\" refers to cases \"used and practised\" in New Hampshire, and not to cases \"used and practised\" elsewhere. This is the natural meaning of the language, and is the only construction which does not involve serious difficulties. \"It can scarcely be supposed that the founders of the New Hampshire constitution intended to make so radical a\nchange in their legal procedure as to deprive a party of a jury trial, if it should appear that, although trial by jury had, in a particular case, been used and practised in New Hampshire, a contrary practice prevailed in England or elsewhere. Yet such would be the logical deduction if the wide construction of the excepting clause, now objected to, shall be held the true one.\"\n\n\"If `heretofore used and practised' meant used and practised anywhere, or even generally, the power given in Article 20 to the legislature to dispense with a jury, if it saw fit, in cases arising on the high seas and relating to mariners' wages, was superfluous. Admiralty powers already existed in England and in other states.\" (The foregoing quotations are taken, in substance, from the argument of the defendant's counsel in Dole v. Wooldredge,  142 Mass. 161 ,  174 ,  175 . The case went off on the ground that the defendant had waived his right, if he had any; but the court pronounced the defendant's argument \"excellent.\") C. Allen, J., 142 Mass. 178 . The whole difficulty in determining in what cases parties have a constitutional right of trial by jury \"would seem to lie in settling the historical question as to what cases were, and what cases were not, tried by jury before the adoption of the constitution.\" Ald. Eq. Pl.  Pr. 161.\n\nThe answer to this \"historical question\" would seem decisive here. Probably no intelligent lawyer has ever supposed that, up to 1792, any other remedy than by indictment had ever been enforced in the case of an alleged public nuisance, or that any other tribunal than a jury had ever passed upon the facts in such a case The remedy by indictment was then, as now, efficacious. Judgment could be given, not only for the punishment of the offender, but for the abatement and removal of the nuisance. 1 Bish. Cr. L., 7th ed., s. 1079; 2 ib., s. 1285.\n\nThe maintenance of a bill in equity by the attorney-general to restrain a public nuisance was then almost an experiment in England. The instances of it were said, nineteen years later, to be \"very confined and rare;\" and, more than forty years later, it was said that the jurisdiction of courts of equity over nuisances by injunction \"is of recent growth, has not till very lately been much exercised, and had at various times found great reluctance on the part of the learned judges to use it, even in cases where the thing or the act complained of was admitted to be directly and immediately hurtful to the complainant.\" Lord Brougham, Chancellor, in Earl of Ripon v. Hobart, 3 Myl.  K. 169. Chancellor Kent, in 1817, evidently regarded equity jurisdiction over public nuisances as a very doubtful matter. See 2 Johns. Ch. 381. In 1842, the supreme court of Connecticut, speaking of the practice in the English courts of equity of entertaining informations at the suit of the attorney-general for the purpose of abating public nuisances, said, &#8212; \"That mode of proceeding has been, however, hitherto unknown here; and whether it would be tolerated in any case, it\nis unnecessary to consider.\" Bigelow v. Company,  14 Conn. 565 , p. 579.\n\nDoes any one believe that this equity jurisdiction, then so hesitatingly assumed and so rarely exercised in England, had ever been used and practised on in New Hampshire before 1792? Or, to put the question in another form, Does any one believe that the members of the constitutional convention of 1791 intended to except cases of alleged public nuisance from the general constitutional provision requiring trial by jury?\n\nSuppose, however, that the framers of our constitution intended to adopt the entire English equity practice of that day, and hence must be regarded as excepting from the right of jury trial all equity cases where a jury trial was not allowed by the then existing English practice: the result still remains that these defendants are entitled to a jury trial. They would then have been held entitled (as we shall presently show) to such a trial if proceeded against in the English chancery by bill in equity in the name of the attorney-general. They are, therefore, entitled to such a trial when proceeded against here in that manner. We are aware that this court has said, \"In proceedings in equity, the parties have no constitutional right of trial by jury.\" Bellows v. Bellows,  58 N.H. 60 . But the court could have intended only to state this doctrine as applying to the great bulk of equity cases. The general proposition thus enunciated was undoubtedly founded on the historical fact that a jury trial was not requisite in the great majority of equity cases. But when we find it to be also an historical fact that there were certain classes of cases in equity where a jury trial was then invariably had, it is impossible to maintain that the constitution did not intend to preserve a jury trial in those classes of cases. Such cases are triable by jury, because they are not \"cases in which it has been heretofore otherwise used and practised,\" and hence do not fall within the constitutional exception.\n\nWe affirm that in 1792 it was the invariable practice of English courts of equity to require the question of fact to be tried by jury before granting a permanent injunction against an alleged public nuisance which did not involve an invasion of soil of which the fee was in the crown. A temporary injunction might be granted pending the jury trial, but no permanent injunction issued until after such trial. The court of exchequer sometimes granted permanent relief without a jury trial; but this was only in cases where the act complained of was a violation of the proprietary rights of the crown, an encroachment upon soil of which the fee was in the crown. The soil in tidal rivers, the seashore between high and low water-mark, and the soil of the harbors belonged to the crown. Gould Waters 7, 8.\n\nA violation of or encroachment upon this soil of the crown was called a purpresture, while an act merely obstructing the public right of passage was called a nuisance. Of course, the same wrongful\nact might be an invasion of both the jus privatum and the jus publicum: the same structure might be both a purpresture and a nuisance, &#8212; a purpresture, because it encroached on the soil belonging to the crown; a nuisance, because it obstructed the public right of passage over that soil. In such a case the injury to the rights of the king and the rights of his subjects might be redressed in the same proceeding. And in this class of cases the court of exchequer, which had jurisdiction of suits for property belonging to the crown, seems to have granted permanent relief without a jury trial. But when the alleged offence consisted simply in obstructing the public passage, and did not involve an invasion of the proprietary right of the crown, the case was not finally disposed of until after a jury trial. To prove the existence of this distinction between the two classes of cases, and also to prove that a jury trial was invariably had in the latter class, we may safely rely on the testimony of Lord Chancellor Eldon, given in 1811, in his opinion in Attorney-General v. Cleaver, 18 Ves. 211, 217, 218:\n\n\"The instances of the interposition of this court upon the subject of nuisance being very confined and rare, more is, I believe, to be collected from what has been done in the court of exchequer, upon discussion of the right of the attorney-general, by some species of information, to seek, on the equitable side of the court, relief as to nuisance; and, if I may use those terms, preventive relief. The case cited by Lord Hardwicke as having occurred before Lord King, was an information here, by the attorney-general, against a public nuisance by stopping a highway. Analogous to that there have been many cases, in the court of exchequer, of nuisance to harbours, which are a species of highway; and, if the soil belongs to the crown, there is one species of remedy for that: the crown may abate the obstruction, as it is upon the king's soil. Where it is not upon the king's soil, but merely a public nuisance to all the king's subjects, though the suit may be in the same form, the law is laid down in treatises, particularly by Lord Hale, De Portibus Maris, that upon the ground of a public nuisance, and not as an obstruction upon the king's soil, it is a question of fact, which must be tried by a jury; and, though the suit may be entertained, the court would be bound to try the fact by the intervention of a jury.\" 18 Ves. 217, 218.\n\nThe same principles are laid down in 2 Sto. Eq., s. 923: \"If the soil belongs to the crown, there is a species of remedy for the purpresture above mentioned for that. If the soil does not belong to the crown, but it is merely a common nuisance to all the public, an information in equity lies. But the question of nuisance, or not, must in cases of doubt be tried by a jury, and the injunction will be granted, or not, as that fact is decided.\" So in Attorney-General v. Company, 2 Green Ch. 136, 142, Vroom, Chancellor, said, &#8212; \"The fact whether it be a nuisance or not is proper to be tried by jury, whether the proceeding be in this court or elsewhere;\n. . .\" (These authorities far outweigh the inconsiderate statement of Harlan, J., in Mugler v. Kansas,  123 U.S. 623 ,  673 .) The cases where the court of exchequer has granted permanent relief without a jury trial belong to the class we have referred to, viz., where the alleged public nuisance was also an invasion of the proprietary rights of the crown. Thus, Attorney-General v. Richards, 2 Anst. 603 (decided about 1795), was an information to abate certain buildings erected by the defendant between high and low water-mark in Portsmouth harbor. The decision was put upon the ground \"that the soil is the property of the crown.\" Macdonald, C. B., said, 615, 616, &#8212; \". . . it is contended that this court cannot give such a decree, or at least not without the intervention of a jury, the question of nuisance being, as laid down by Lord Hale, a question of fact and not of law. That may be where the question is of nuisance only, and the evidence doubtful. But the cases cited, and those which Lord Hale has given us in the treatise De Portibus Maris, clearly prove that where the king claims and proves a right to the soil, where a purpresture and nuisance have been committed, he may have a decree to abate it. . . . Supported by such authority, we do not hesitate to declare that the soil is the property of the crown; and of course to decree that these buildings be abated.\"\n\nWe call particular attention to the elaborate comments of Chancellor Kent on the above decision. 2 Johns. Ch. 381-383. Attorney-General v. Burridge, 10 Price 350 (where the question of fact was sent to a jury, but such a course was said to be unnecessary if there was no reasonable doubt), was an \"information by English bill\" on account of an obstruction in Portsmouth harbor, where the soil belonged to the crown.\n\nBond's Case, More 238, decided in the Exchequer 29 Elizabeth, is explainable on the same ground. The alleged nuisance in that case (a pigeon-house) was erected on crown land, the defendant being tenant for years of a parcel of a manor which belonged to the queen. Attorney-General v. Forbes, 2 Myl.  Cr. 123, was heard on demurrer; and no question was made as to the mode of ultimate trial of the facts. In Attorney-General v. Johnson, 2 Wils. Ch. 87, a temporary injunction was continued until after the trial of a pending indictment. In Attorney-General v. Cohoes Co., 6 Paige 133, the wrongful act complained of was committed upon an embankment and lands belonging to the state, forming part of the Erie and Champlain canals.\n\nIt is very clear that the present case is not a case of purpresture, or invasion of the soil of the state, like the cases decided in the Exchequer, and cited above. The bed of the Connecticut river at Lebanon and Norwich belongs to the riparian owners, and not to the state. The doctrine of private ownership of the soil \"has been held applicable to the Connecticut river above the tide, in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire . . .\" Gould\nWaters, s. 56, p. 118; Kimball v. Schoff,  40 N.H. 190 . It follows, that if the bill in the name of the attorney-general is to take the same course it would have taken in an English court of equity in 1792, no permanent relief can be granted until after a trial of the facts by a jury.\n\nIf the foregoing views are correct, it is clear that, before recent statutory changes in the law of procedure, this controversy could not have been constitutionally decided adversely to the defendants until after a jury trial. In 1867, upon the revision of the statutes, an amendment was enacted expressly giving the court equity jurisdiction in cases of nuisance &#8212; G. S., c. 190, s. 1; and in 1885, c. 87 was passed, providing as follows: \"Section 1. Any legal right, public or private, infringed by a change in the water level of any natural lake or pond, and the water-rights of riparian proprietors on any stream, may be ascertained and enforced in a constitutional manner on a bill in equity without ascertainment of the right by a suit at law, and rights of boating, fishing, and navigation may be enforced on a bill in equity brought by the attorney-general in the name of the state.\" Do these enactments have the effect of depriving the defendants of the constitutional right of trial by jury which they previously had? They do not, for the short reason that such a result is beyond the power of the legislature. If they can change to a certain extent the form of procedure, still they cannot take away the constitutional right of trial by jury. \"The statute has changed the mode of procedure, but it would be trifling with the constitution to hold that, by changing the forms of procedure, the substantial rights declared by it can be taken away. In all controversies which are within the purview of that article of the declaration of rights, the `method of procedure' of a trial by jury must be held sacred, whatever the other forms of procedure may be.\" Field, J., in Powers v. Raymond,  137 Mass. 483 ,  486 ; &#8212; see, also,  143 Mass. 545 ; Coal Co. v. Snowden, 42 Pa. St. 488. We must, however, do the legislature the justice to say that we do not believe that either of these statutes was designed to take away trial by jury. Indeed, the phraseology of the statute of 1885 (\"in constitutional manner\") tends to show that the legislature were aware of the constitutional right, and did not intend to disturb it.\n\nStatutes are, if possible, to be so construed as not to be repugnant to the constitution. Bish. Wr. L., s. 90. The statute of 1885 is to be construed as meaning that a court of equity should proceed in a constitutional manner, and allow a jury trial wherever it would have been allowed before the passage of that statute. In other words, the jurisdiction thereby conferred on the court of equity is subject to the implied provision that a jury trial is to be allowed wherever it is a matter of constitutional right. This principle of construction was applied in Gage v. Ewing,  107 Ill. 11 . If we should admit that the defendants are bound to furnish reasonably convenient facilities for the passage of logs, still it is not required to\nprovide the same facilities as existed before the erection of the dam. Foster v. Company,  79 Me. 508 . Nor are the defendants under obligation to provide a way for the passage of logs over the dam, better than would be afforded by the natural condition of the river unobstructed by the dam. The plaintiffs' right of passage is to the natural flow of the river as it was before any improvements by the defendants, or by any other parties under whom the defendants claim. A mill-owner is not under legal obligation to furnish any public passage for logs over his dam or through his mills at any time when the river at such place, in its natural condition, does not contain water enough to be floatable if unobstructed by mills, although the river is generally of a floatable character. Pearson v. Rolfe,  76 Me. 380 . Even if the defendants are bound (which we do not admit) by the restrictions in the charter of 1807, the foregoing propositions would still be applicable. It is clear that the erection of the dam must necessarily cause some obstruction and inconvenience in the passage of lumber. The proviso in the act of 1807 (if considered as annexed to the charter of 1848) must be construed as prohibiting only the erection of such a dam as would unreasonably impede the passage of lumber, and not as requiring that lumber should be permitted to pass in precisely the same manner as before the erection of a dam. The opposite construction would render the grant of the right to erect a dam utterly nugatory; and such a repugnant construction is not to be adopted.\n\nJeremiah Smith, for the defendants; &#8212; second brief. The brief already furnished by the defendants related chiefly to the question of the right of trial by jury. The principal purpose of the present brief is to offer some suggestions as to the rules of law to be applied on the trial; especially in reference to the rights of the defendants under their charter granted in 1848, and amended in 1881. Laws of 1848, c. 674; Laws of 1881, c. 183. The material portions of the charter are as follows:\n\n\"Laws of 1848. Chap. 674. An act to incorporate the White River Falls Corporation. Approved June 23, 1848.\n\n\"Section 1. Be it enacted, etc., that James Harris, Rufus Choate [and others], their associates, successors, and assigns, be and they are hereby made a body politic and corporate by the name of the White River Falls Corporation, for the purpose of making and maintaining a water-power and manufactories at White River falls on Connecticut river; said water-power to be used by said corporation, or leased and conveyed to others, to be used for and in the manufacture of wool, cotton, wood, iron, and other metals and materials; and for these purposes said corporation may make and establish all necessary rules, regulations, and by-laws, and shall have, use, and enjoy all the rights, powers, and privileges necessary and proper to carry these objects into full effect.\n\n\"Sec. 2. [Relates to property and capital stock.]\n\n\"Sec. 3. Said corporation is hereby authorized and empowered to make and maintain all such works as may be necessary and proper to carry into effect the objects aforesaid, on and across the Connecticut river, in any suitable place or places at White River falls, from the head thereof at the upper bar to the foot of the same at the Phelps bar, so called, and to make and maintain all such canals and slips as may be necessary and proper for the purpose aforesaid. Provided, That this grant shall not be held or construed to impair any rights, powers, and privileges heretofore granted by the legislature of this state, within the limits aforesaid.\n\n\"Sec. 4. Said corporation is hereby authorized and empowered to purchase, hold, and enjoy all the corporate and other rights, powers, and privileges heretofore granted and now enjoyed within the limits of this grant, subject to all the duties and liabilities now legally binding on said corporate rights, powers, and privileges.\"\n\n\"Laws of 1881. Chapter 183. An act to change the name and amend the charter of the White River Falls Company, passed at the June session, 1848. Approved July 21, 1881.\n\n\"Section 1. That the name of said corporation shall be the `Olcott Falls Company,' instead of White River Falls Company as provided in said charter, and said corporation is hereby authorized to improve the water-power on the Connecticut river in the town of Lebanon in this state, and carry on such various manufactures as it may from time to time desire.\"\n\nExcept so far as restrained by the United States constitution, the state of New Hampshire possesses the power to authorize the obstruction of any navigable river within its limits. Every sovereign state has the power completely to obstruct the public passage over a public water-way. No private right of property is invaded by such governmental action, which is merely a public regulation of a public right. See Lord, J., in Thayer v. Railroad,  125 Mass. 253 ,  257 ; and compare Field, J., in Miller v. New York, 109 U.S. 385 ,  393 ,  395 . Public navigation may be impeded when and so far as the sovereign power shall judge that the public good requires it; and if one immediate object of the impediment appears to be the profit of the grantee, it is the right and duty of the sovereign power to determine whether the public interest be so connected with the private benefit as to authorize the grant. To hold otherwise would be to prevent the union of public and private interests for the accomplishment of any object. The legislature has repeatedly granted authority to erect obstructions, not for the purpose of ultimately increasing the facilities for navigation, but for the promotion of a common benefit in a manner entirely disconnected with navigation, &#8212; such as the construction of dams to create a\nwater-power for different manufacturing purposes, or to control and withdraw the water to supply aqueducts, and the building of bridges and causeways to facilitate intercourse by land. That a sovereign state may thus authorize the obstruction of water-ways within its limits is a proposition fully sustained by authority. Dover v. Portsmouth Bridge, 17 N.H. 200 ,  219 ,  220 ; Shepley, J., in Parker v. Company,  20 Me. 353 ,  357 ; May, J., in Treat v. Lord,  42 Me. 552 ,  560 ; Shaw, C. J., in Davidson v. Railroad, 3 Cush. 91, 106; South Carolina v. Georgia,  93 U.S. 4 ,  10 ; Gould Waters, s. 132.\n\nThe present case is not affected by the fact that the state of New Hampshire has become a member of the Federal Union; nor by the fact that the Connecticut river is not wholly confined within the limits of the state, but, after leaving the southern border of New Hampshire, flows through two other states, and ultimately runs into the ocean. Undoubtedly congress has paramount power to legislate in reference to the navigation of this river, but until congress shall see fit to exercise this power, the state may legislate in respect to so much of the river as is within its territory. \"The states are free to legislate with respect to their internal waters, so long as the superior power of congress remains dormant.\" Gould Waters, ss. 130, 132. \"Until congress intervenes in such cases and exercises its authority, the power of the state is plenary.\" Field, J., in Hamilton v. Railroad,  119 U.S. 280 ,  281 . This view is sustained by several decisions of the supreme court of the United States, as well as by a decision of our state court. Willson v. Company, 2 Pet. 250; Pound v. Turck,  95 U.S. 459 ; Gilman v. Philadelphia, 3 Wall. 713; Escanaba Co. v. Chicago,  107 U.S. 678 ; Dover v. Portsmouth Bridge,  17 N.H. 200 ,  224-230 .\n\nThe doctrine of the above cited United States cases cannot be distinguished from the present, upon the ground that the streams there under consideration were wholly within the limits of the state whose legislation was in question. Those streams were all tributaries of larger bodies of water, flowing through other states or flowing ultimately into the ocean. Either by themselves or by their connection with other waters they formed a continuous channel over which commerce might be carried on with other states or with foreign countries. Thus the rivers under consideration, in 2 Peters 250 and 3 Wallace 715, are both tributaries of the Delaware river, which flows into the Atlantic ocean. So the Chippewa river ( 95 U.S. 459 ,  462 ) empties its waters into the Mississippi, and the Chicago river ( 107 U.S. 678 ) runs into Lake Michigan. All of these streams are capable of being used, and were used, for interstate or for foreign commerce; and yet it was held, that, in the absence of congressional legislation, the different states had the power to regulate or obstruct the navigation of so much of the water-ways as were within their respective borders. The doctrine thus held must apply to the right of New Hampshire\nto legislate in regard to the Connecticut river. If the foregoing views are correct, it follows that the state had the power to authorize the defendants completely to obstruct the public passage of logs down the Connecticut river.\n\nThe next question is, How far has the state seen fit to exercise this power? Two views, representing opposite extremes, may be suggested. On the one hand, it may be claimed that the legislature, by the terms of the charter, intended to authorize the defendants completely to obstruct the public passage of logs; or, in other words, to build the dam without any reference to the convenience of log-owners. On the other hand, it may be claimed that the legislature intended to subject the manufacturing company to the implied condition that the dam should be so constructed as to afford precisely the same facilities for the passage of logs as existed before its erection. Neither of these extreme views is correct.\n\nThe true doctrine is, that the grant of the right to build a dam necessarily implies the right to cause some obstruction to the passage of logs; but that the grant must be regarded as subject to the implied limitation that the dam shall be so built as to create no obstructions except such as are reasonably necessary to the beneficial maintenance and use of the dam for manufacturing purposes. In determining this question of reasonable necessity, a jury is to take into account not only the requirements and convenience of floatation, but also the requirements and convenience of manufacturing. The latter is a public use, as well as the former. See Perley, C. J., in Great Falls Mfg. Co. v. Fernald,  47 N.H. 444 , 457 ,  458 ,  460 ,  461 . The legislature, in granting the manufacturing charter, have, in effect, \"surrendered some part of the public right [of passage] to the mill occupiers for the supposed public good.\" \"A part of the public right is granted to them for a supposed gain which the public obtains through the use of mills.\" Peters, C. J.,  76 Me. 386 . The legislative act authorizing the obstruction of the water-way \"is in fact only an appropriation by the public of a public right, to a certain extent, to another public use.\" The fact that the last public use must necessarily, to some extent, impair the former public use, must be presumed to have been known to the legislature.\n\nThe jury, in passing on the question of the reasonable sufficiency of the sluice-way, are not to proceed upon the theory that the public right of floatation is superior to the public right of manufacturing. The reasonableness of the sluice-way is to be determined, not solely in view of the interest and convenience of the log-owner, but in view, also, of the interest and convenience of the manufacturer. The most favorable view that can be taken for the plaintiffs is to say that the two rights are correlative, and that each operates as a limitation on the other. See Rindge v. Sargent,  64 N.H. 294 . Here are two uses for which the waters of the\nstate are available, &#8212; floatation and manufacturing. Of these, the latter is by far the more beneficial to the state; and the plaintiffs cannot complain if it be treated by the legislature or the court as of at least equal importance with the former. See Perley, C. J., in Great Falls Mfg. Co. v. Fernald, supra. Neither use can be fully enjoyed without some diminution of or obstruction to the exercise of the other. The legislature has power to say how far either shall give way to the other. When they expressly authorize the exercise of one use, they certainly are not to be understood as implying that this use shall, in all cases of conflict, give way entirely to the exercise of the other use. To say that the log-driver is entitled to the same facilities for running his logs after the erection of the dam as he had before, is to say that the grant of the right to erect a dam is practically nugatory. A dam built in such a form as to preserve these facilities could hardly admit of beneficial use by a manufacturer. A similar claim has been disallowed by the supreme court of Maine. The court said, &#8212; \"The right to erect a dam upon a non-tidal stream (and we are speaking of no others) is a clear statutory right. The legislature in creating it must have foreseen that its exercise would to some extent necessarily interfere with the use of such streams as highways. It is impossible to believe that the legislature intended that this newly created right should be burdened with the expensive if not impossible obligation of providing for log-drivers the same facilities for running their logs as they had before. If the legislature had so intended, it would have said so. The statute imposes no such obligation. It is silent upon the subject.\" Walton, J., in Foster v. Company,  79 Me. 508 ,  511 . The court may, by Judicial construction, engraft upon the statute a condition in favor of log-drivers to the extent of requiring mill-owners to furnish such facilities for the passage of logs as are consistent with the maintenance and reasonable enjoyment of the dam. But this is the utmost extent to which construction can go in limiting the legislative grant, which is, in terms, wholly unlimited.\n\nWe may safely concede that the power conferred by the charter of the manufacturing company must be so exercised as not to injure the interests of others more than is reasonably necessary to accomplish the purpose for which the charter was granted. In other words, an act of the legislature should not be construed as authorizing any unnecessary infringement of existing public privileges. But this concession only shows that the harm likely to be caused by the dam was intended to be mitigated, so far as reasonably consistent with its erection and beneficial use, and not that the dam was to be so built as to present no material obstruction to navigation. See Pound v. Turck,  95 U.S. 459 ,  461 . The legislature must have understood that a dam across the Connecticut river at Lebanon, with any kind of a sluice-way which could be made, would to some extent interfere with the passage of logs.\n\nThe legislature may fairly be supposed to have taken into account the fact that the stream at the place in question, though in a certain sense navigable, is not capable of general or extended navigation. The only useful purpose for which the public use its waters is the floatation of logs. \"A floatable stream is the least important of the classes of streams called navigable.\" Peters, C. J.,  76 Me. 385 . \"The rights of the public are not superior to private rights, in streams that are merely floatable, to the same extent as in rivers which are capable of more extended navigation. In the latter the public right extends equally to all navigable portions of the river. But the right of floating is not paramount to the use of water for machinery, and the rights of the public and those of the riparian owners are both to be enjoyed with proper regard to the existence and preservation of the other.\" Gould Waters, s. 110. Even in the case of riparian owners who are manufacturing without any special legislative authority, the right to use the water for machinery is not treated as subordinate to the right to use it for the passage of logs. In a Michigan case (not directly in point here), Cooley, J., said, &#8212; \"Flat river is a stream valuable for floatage, but not for navigation in the more enlarged meaning of the term. On such a stream it cannot be said that the right of floatage is paramount to the use of the water for machinery. Each right should be enjoyed with due regard to the existence and protection of the other.\" Middleton v. Company,  27 Mich. 533 ,  535 . Of course there is a sense in which the right of passage is the dominant or superior right, \"and necessarily so from the very nature of things;\" \"because it is a right that cannot be very well exercised unless the other right temporarily yields to it.\" \"It is a right to move on or by.\" It may sometimes be necessary that the stationary obstacle shall yield temporarily, in order to give it a chance to go by. But the right of passage \"is not an exclusive right.\" \"Its use must not be usurping, excessive, and unreasonable.\" \"It is not a privilege of moving at all times, with any quantities, and without any delay, and under all circumstances. The two rights come in conflict. One does not destroy the other. Each influences the other.\" Peters, C. J., 76 Me. 390 ,  391 .\n\nThe plaintiffs cite Hooksett v. Company,  44 N.H. 106 , as to the construction of the charter; but the point there under discussion was, whether the charter authorized the defendants to damage private property  &#8212; a question not here presented. In that case, and in Eastman v. Company, 44 N.H. 143 , it was intimated that the charter protected the defendants from an indictment for a nuisance in obstructing the river. See 44 N.H. 110 ,  160 . Even if the charter had contained an express provision against impeding the passage of logs, the proviso could not have received a literal enforcement; for that would defeat the main intent of the charter. The Pennsylvania statute for the building of dams on a certain class of streams contained a proviso that the dams should not\nobstruct or impede the navigation of the streams. In Ensworth v. Com., 52 Pa. St. 320, 323, Strong, J., said, as to this proviso, &#8212; \"A literal construction would make it contrary to the grant itself, all dams causing some impediment to navigation. The act of assembly must be so construed that it shall mean something; and clearly the legislature intended to authorize the erection and maintenance of some dams. But if the proviso is construed literally, either it or the grant must yield; and the rule is, that a proviso or exception contrary to a grant is void. Both, however, may stand if the proviso be construed reasonably in connection with the authority given, as it was manifestly understood by the legislature. A dam is not, then, unauthorized by the act of 1803 merely because it is in some sense an obstruction.\" In the present case, the law (the charter) authorizing the building of the dam contains no express limitation as to obstructing the passage of logs. Whatever limitation is held to exist, can exist only by implication. And there is no ground for implying a limitation of such a nature as to defeat the remain object of the charter.\n\nThe plaintiffs are understood to assert that the defendants have purchased the corporate rights of another company, and that they therefore can claim no greater authority to obstruct the river than belonged to that other company. This construction is based on s. 4 of the charter of 1848, and on the assumption that the defendants have purchased the corporate rights granted in 1807 to Mills Olcott and others. No evidence has yet been produced to show that the defendants have purchased the rights of any earlier corporation; but if it could be proved that they have bought out the rights conferred by the charter of 1807, the consequence claimed by the plaintiffs would not follow. The purchase of the rights conferred by the charter of 1807 would not diminish or destroy the rights conferred by the charter of 1848.\n\nThe rights of the defendants in regard to maintaining their dam for manufacturing purposes are not affected by anything contained in s. 4 of the act of 1848. The rights granted to the defendants in 1848 are not limited or restricted to the rights granted to Mills Olcott and others in 1807. A careful consideration of the purposes and objects of the respective acts of 1807 and 1848 sustains this view.\n\nThe act of 1807 creates a navigation company. The act of 1848 establishes a manufacturing company. The objects and requirements of the two corporations are widely different, and the powers conferred on each corporation are essentially diverse. In order to prevent a possible conflict of rights between the manufacturing company and any earlier corporation, the manufacturing company is expressly authorized \"to purchase, hold, and enjoy all the corporate and other rights, powers, and privileges heretofore granted and now enjoyed within the limits of this grant, subject to all the duties and liabilities now legally binding on said corporate\nrights, powers, and privileges.\" This provision was not inserted for the purpose of limiting or nullifying the rights granted by the previous sections of the charter. It was not added for the purpose of lessening, but rather increasing, the powers and rights of the company. If s. 4 is construed as limiting the manufacturing corporation to those rights only which had previously been conferred on the navigation company, the result is that s. 4 nullifies the rest of the charter. The charter of 1848, in that view, would simply amount to changing the name of the navigation company. If the manufacturing company is, by this section, restricted to the rights which previously belonged to the navigation company, then the so called manufacturing company has no power to carry on the business of manufacturing, but must confine itself strictly to the business of a navigation company. A construction which involves such repugnancy between s. 4 and the rest of the charter ought not to be adopted, unless the language of the legislature is too explicit to admit of any other interpretation. A fortiori, this repugnant construction ought not to be adopted if it does not accord with the natural meaning of the statutory expressions. The phrase \"duties and liabilities\" would not ordinarily be understood as referring to the absence of authority or to the lack of corporate power. The phrase would be understood as referring, not to restrictions on authority, but to obligations of an affirmative nature, the affirmative performance of which is incumbent on the corporation. The act of 1807 does not say that the grantees are under \"a duty or liability\" not to obstruct the passage of logs. It simply says that the legislative charter does not give them authority to create such obstructions. Want of authority is in no proper sense \"a duty or liability.\" The navigation company, if in existence in 1848, was probably subject to various affirmative \"duties and liabilities,\" -such as the duty to permit the passage of logs through its locks and canals upon the payment of such tolls as might be established by the legislature, and the duty to pay its debts. It is to \"duties and liabilities\" such as these that the language of s. 4 refers.\n\nThe charter of 1848 contemplates the possession by the manufacturing company of two classes of rights, &#8212; one class being the powers expressly granted by ss. 1 and 3, the other class being the powers originally conferred on the navigation company, and purchasable by the manufacturing company under s. 4. It could not have been the legislative intention that the purchase of the latter class of powers should essentially curtail and practically annihilate the former class of powers, which are essential to carrying out the purposes of the corporation. By buying out the navigation company, the manufacturing company would acquire the right to do, for the purpose of improving navigation, no more than the old navigation company could have done. But the manufacturing company would not, by reason of such purchase, forfeit the right already conferred by their own charter to do certain other acts and\nexercise certain other powers, in order to improve the water-power and carry on the business of manufacturing. The defendants cannot resist this suit on the ground that they were authorized under the act of 1807 to build the present dam for the purpose of improving the navigation; but they can defend on the ground that they were authorized, under the act of 1848, to build this dam for the purpose of using the water-power in manufacturing. Even if the original charter of 1848 is construed as restricting the manufacturing company to the authority previously conferred on the navigation company, it does not follow that the amended charter of 1881 must receive the same interpretation. The amendment of 1881 contains no reference whatever to the powers or duties of any other company. On the contrary, the act of 1881 confers on the defendant corporation authority (in terms entirely unlimited) \"to improve the water-power on the Connecticut river, in the town of Lebanon in this state, and carry on such various manufactures as it may from time to time desire.\"\n\nWhatever view may be adopted as to the preceding points, it is very clear that the defendants are not under legal obligation to provide a public way for the passage of logs over their dam, better than would be afforded by the natural condition of the river unobstructed by their dam. The plaintiffs' utmost right of passage can be only to the natural flow of the river or its equivalent. A mill-owner is under no legal obligation to furnish any public passage for logs over his dam at a time when the river at such place, in its natural condition, does not contain water enough to be floatable if unobstructed by mills, although the river is generally of a floatable character. Pearson v. Rolfe,  76 Me. 380 . Rolfe had a quantity of logs in the river which he was unable in the dry season to drive over the dam at Pearson's mills, unless Pearson would shut down his mill gates, thereby suspending his own business of manufacturing until water enough should accumulate in his mill-pond to float the logs over. This Pearson refused to do, basing his refusal upon the allegation that the driftway in the dam, without shutting down his working-gates, afforded all the facility for floating logs by his mills that existed in the river at that place in its natural state, as much as there would be provided his mills and all of his structures were entirely out of the way. Held, that, upon the facts as alleged by Pearson, his refusal was justified. If it be said that the log-owner is entitled to use the water raised by the mill-dam, the answer is that he is entitled to use it only \"to get down to the dam, and not to get over or past it.\" The mill-owner is not bound to allow log-owners the use of his dam and mills \"to create, not a natural, but an unnatural, flow upon the river.\" Would not the mill-owner \"be permitted to remove his structure, leaving the river in its natural state\"? \"If he can do that, cannot he hoist his millgates at his pleasure for business purposes, allowing the water to pass his mills in manner and quantity equivalent, as near as may\nbe, to its ordinary condition and natural flow?\" Peters, C. J.,  76 Me. 387 , 388 .\n\nWe add, by way of supplement to our first brief, some suggestions as to the right of trial by jury. In the former brief, it was taken for granted that up to 1792 cases of alleged public nuisance were triable by jury. We are now indebted to the industrious research of Hon. W. L. Foster, counsel for the defendant in State v. Saunders, for positive proof that our assumption was well founded. Judge Foster has unearthed a provincial statute, enacted in 1718, the material portion of which is as follows:\n\n\"An Act for Prevention of Common Nusances arising by Slaughter-Houses, Still-Houses, c., and Curriers.\n\n\"Be it Enacted by His Excellency the Governour, Council, and Representatives, Convened in General Assembly, and by the Authority of the same, That when and so often from time to time, as it shall appear, that any Slaughter-Houses for killing of Meat, Still-Houses, and Houses for Trying of Tallow, and Currying of Leather to become a Nusance, by reason of offensive and ill Stenches proceeding from the same, or otherwise hurtful to the Neighborhood; It shall and may be lawful to and for the Court of General Sessions of the Peace, within this Province, to cause inquiry to be made therein by a Jury, and to suppress such Nusance by prohibiting, and restraining the further use thereof for the exercise of either of the aforesaid Trades, or Mysteries; under a fine not exceeding Forty Shillings a month, to be to the use of the Poor of such Town where the offence is committed; or otherwise as in their discretion, they shall think fit, by causing the said Nusance to be removed or prevented; or any other Nusance to be inquired of in manner aforesaid.\"\n\nIt may, perhaps, be argued, that notwithstanding the above statute, the provincial court of appeals, composed of the governor and council, had a theoretical equity jurisdiction in cases of nuisance, and was entitled to proceed without a jury. But even this theoretical equity jurisdiction (which had long been practically obsolete) terminated sixteen years before the adoption of the present constitution, the court of appeals having been abolished in 1776. In 1792, and for sixteen years prior thereto, there was no court competent to try the question of nuisance without a jury; and, on the other hand, there was during all that time a court in which this question was triable by jury. It seems too clear for argument, that the constitution of 1792 was not intended to lessen the right of trial by jury as it then existed. If any particular class of controversies was then triable by jury, and not triable by any other method, it was intended to preserve the right of trial by jury, in that class of controversies. The constitution did not intend to deprive any person of the right to try a controversy by jury, if such a controversy was triable by jury, and only by jury, in 1792. \"The\nconstitutional provision does not create, nor enlarge, nor restrict the right of trial by jury, but retains and preserves it inviolate in all those classes of cases, civil and criminal, in which it existed at the time of the adoption of the constitution.\" \"As a constitution speaks from the time of its adoption, the fact of the right to jury trial which is ascertained to have existed at that time, must necessarily determine the meaning of the clause which recognizes and preserves that right.\" \"The ultimate test and limit of the constitutional guaranty is to be found in a historical fact. . . .\" Pomeroy's Notes to Sedgwick Stat.  Const. Law 486-488.\n\nThis principle is illustrated in Baker v. Holderness,  26 N.H. 110 ,  114 , though that case was, so far as facts are concerned, the converse of the present case. The controversy there in question was one of a class which had been triable by jury up to 1786, and triable without a jury from 1786 to 1792. It was held, that the constitution did not reserve the right of jury trial in such cases, inasmuch as at the time of the adoption of the constitution, and for six years next preceding, it was not the use and practice to submit such a question to a jury. That case is the converse of this. At the time of the adoption of the constitution, and for at least sixteen years next preceding, it was the use and practice to submit to a jury the question of fact here raised. Hence the right of trying such a question by jury is preserved by the constitution.\n\nThis view does not necessitate the conclusion that there is a constitutional right of trial by jury in all equity cases. There is a large class of controversies over which the jurisdiction of equity is exclusive. In the absence of a court of equity, controversies of this class were not triable at all. To hold that such controversies are now triable in equity without a jury, does not amount to taking away a right of jury trial which existed in 1792, for, as to this class of cases, there was not at that time any method of trial whatever. Take, for example, a dispute as to whether a written contract shall be reformed by parol evidence: there was not in New Hampshire in 1792, nor since 1776, any process by which such reformation could be brought about; there was no court competent to try and determine such a question. No common-law court had jurisdiction over such a question, and there was then no court of equity. If, therefore, a court of equity today decides such a question without a jury, the defendant is not deprived of a method of trial which he would have had at the time the constitution was adopted. See Stockbridge Iron Co. v. Company, 102 Mass. 45 ,  48 . But it is an entirely different matter to deny the right of trial by jury in the case of an alleged public nuisance. That question was triable in 1792, and was triable by jury. There was then, as now, a perfectly efficacious remedy by indictment or information. Judgment could be given in such proceeding for the abatement and removal of a nuisance. 1 Bish. Cr. L., 7th ed., s. 1079; 2d ib., s. 1285.\n\nIf it be suggested, that the remedy thus existing in 1792 was criminal and not civil, we reply that the remedy by indictment or information for an alleged public nuisance, though criminal in form, is in substance a civil proceeding. In discussing the general subject of nuisance, Mr. Bishop says, &#8212; \"The doctrine already mentioned, that a criminal proceeding may be in substance and effect civil, and be governed in a degree by the rules of civil suits, has its most apt illustrations in this department.\" 1 Bish. Cr. L., 7th ed., s. 1074. Thus, upon the trial of an indictment for obstructing navigation, evidence that the defendant's servant, in creating the obstruction, acted contrary to his master's orders is not admissible, although such evidence would constitute a complete defence in an ordinary criminal case. Reg. v. Stephens, L. R. 1 Q. B. 702. Mellor, J., said, &#8212; \"It is quite true that this in point of form is a proceeding of a criminal nature, but in substance I think it is in the nature of a civil proceeding . . . The only reason for proceeding criminally is, that the nuisance, instead of being merely a nuisance offending an individual, or one or two individuals, affects the public at large; and no private individual, without receiving some special injury, could have maintained an action. . . Inasmuch as the subject of the indictment is not to punish the defendant, but really to prevent the nuisance from being continued, I think that the evidence which would support a civil action would be sufficient to support an indictment.\" L. R. 1 Q. B. 708-710. The original attempt to maintain a suit in the name of a private plaintiff cannot be sustained (see reasons stated in our first brief). The amendment making the attorney-general a plaintiff is all that gives any vitality to this proceeding. The suit must be maintained as a public proceeding in the name of the attorney-general, or not at all. Now, so far as form is concerned, the present proceeding could be regarded as either criminal or civil, just as the attorney-general might choose to elect. Without changing a single material allegation of fact, that official might call the complaint an information and have it entered on the criminal docket; or he might call it a bill in equity, and have it entered on the civil docket. In either event, there would be the same public prosecutor, the same question of public right, and the same defence. Does the right of trial by jury depend upon form, or upon substance? We find no fault with the present attorney-general; but we ask whether the right of trial by jury is dependent on the name which he may choose to affix to a complaint. Shall it be optional with the attorney-general, by selecting one of two substantially similar remedies, to deprive a defendant of trial by jury? Does the constitution mean that trial by jury is preserved in such cases only as may seem fit to future attorney-generals?\n\nSuppose, however, it should be held that the constitution did not intend to make the New Hampshire practice of 1792 the test of the right to trial by jury, but, rather, the English\nchancery practice prevailing at that date; suppose, in other words, that the constitution intended to deny the right of trial by jury in all cases where it was at that time denied by the English courts of equity: even this doctrine would not deprive the defendants of a jury trial in the present case. In our former brief we have shown that, in 1792, a jury trial was allowed by the English chancery court, as a matter of right, in this class of cases. Whether this allowance was founded on legal truth or legal error, is immaterial. It is enough for us that it was the practice then prevailing in those courts. It is safe to say, that our constitution was not intended to deny the right of trial by jury in New Hampshire in any class of cases where such right was then recognized and allowed in England.\n\nJeremiah Smith, for the defendants, orally. So far as equity cases are concerned, there are two constructions which the plaintiffs may seek to give to the words \"heretofore otherwise used and practised,\" in the Bill of Rights. They may construe the phrase as referring either (1) to the actual practice in New Hampshire, or (2) as referring to the actual practice in the English chancery, which would presumably have furnished the rule for New Hampshire chancery practice if any had existed. We are ready to meet the plaintiffs on either ground. If the plaintiffs prefer to construe the phrase as referring solely to the actual equity practice in New Hampshire at and immediately preceding the adoption of the constitution, our answer will be very short. The burden is not upon us to show that it was the New Hampshire use and practice in 1792 to decide equity cases with the aid of a jury, but upon the plaintiffs to show that it was then the New Hampshire use and practice to decide such cases without a jury. It is for the plaintiffs to show that in equity suits for nuisances it was, in New Hampshire, in 1792, the practice not to allow a jury trial. This the plaintiffs have not shown; and they cannot show it, the fact being that no equity suits whatever were brought in New Hampshire in those days. There was in New Hampshire, in 1792, no court professing or undertaking to exercise chancery jurisdiction. There had been no such court for at least sixteen years. It is a fact, proved beyond all question, that there had been no chancery practice in this state for at least fifty years prior to 1792; and it is highly probable that there had been none for a much longer period. Clearly, if the phrase \"otherwise used and practised\" is to be interpreted as including equity cases, it can have little or no effect or application unless we are to look to the practice then existing in the English chancery courts as the practice intended.\n\nThis latter position is the ground which the plaintiffs will probably adopt. They will say that equity as then administered in England was understood to form part of the common law of New Hampshire; and that the use and practice of the English equity\ncourts furnished the measure of this exception to the constitutional guaranty of trial by jury. In other words, the claim is, that the constitution intended to deny the right of jury trial in equity cases, so far as that right was then denied by the existing equity practice in England. We will, for the purposes of argument, temporarily admit this claim; and we propose, in a few minutes, to show that, even upon this construction of the constitution, these defendants are clearly entitled to a jury trial. But we desire first to note that the plaintiffs can have no possible ground for making any larger claim than that just stated. They cannot have the hardihood to contend that the New Hampshire constitution was intended to lessen the right of trial by jury. They cannot maintain that the constitution intended to authorize the denial of a jury trial in New Hampshire in any class of controversies where it was then invariably allowed in England.\n\nThe plaintiffs cite Bellows v. Bellows,  58 N.H. 60 , where this court said, &#8212; \"In proceedings in equity the parties have no constitutional right of trial by jury.\" It was probably sufficient for the purposes of that case for the court to state a general rule which they deemed applicable to the great bulk of equity cases, without stopping to enumerate the exceptions to that rule. But the court could not have intended to lay down this doctrine as applicable to those well defined classes of equity cases in which trial by jury was invariably a]lowed, as matter of right, under established equity practice.\n\nThere were, in 1792, at least two classes of equity cases where a jury trial was regarded as indispensable before the granting of a final decree (and these classes are entirely distinct from those cases in which an issue was granted as a matter of discretion). One class consisted of those cases in which a court of equity allowed an issue to be sent directly to a jury as a matter of right. Examples of this class are the issue devisavit vel non, and a certain issue relative to tithes. See Ad. Eq. 249; Paine v. Hall, 18 Ves. 475; 2 Dan. Ch., 3d Am. ed., 1088, 1089; Clark v. Society, 45 N.H. 335 ; Ad. Eq. 236; Revel v. Fox, 2 Ves. Sr. 269. The other class comprised those numerous cases where equity declined to take final action in aid of a legal right, until after the question of the existence of the alleged legal right, and also the question of its infringement, had been settled by a suit at law, &#8212; in which suit at law a jury trial was an indispensable incident. As to the practice in these two classes of equity cases, and the consequent result that parties in such cases have here a constitutional right to jury trial, we call attention to Judge Aldrich's work on Equity Pleading and Practice in Massachusetts 160, et seq. The learned author (p. 161) asks, &#8212; \"How, then, can it be doubted that there are equity cases in which, under our constitution, either or both parties have a right to demand a jury trial ?\" He also asks (p. 163), &#8212; \"Why, under our system of laws, which are so scrupulously careful to preserve the sacred right of trial by\njury, should not every party to a suit in equity be held to have a prima facie right to have issues of fact tried by a jury?\"\n\nDoes the present case fall within the class where a jury trial was had? How were controversies of fact arising in equity suits relative to the prevention or abatement of nuisances triable in England in 1792? Was it the use or practice to decide the facts without submission to a jury? We answer, that, where there was a serious controversy of fact, no permanent relief was granted until after a trial of the controverted facts by a jury. Temporary relief was sometimes granted, an interlocutory injunction was sometimes issued, before any jury trial had been had. But if there was any serious controversy of fact, no permanent injunction was issued, no final decree was made in favor of the plaintiff, until after an adjudication by a court of law; and in such adjudication a jury trial was a necessary incident. \"Equity had no more than a qualified jurisdiction; the qualification being a preliminary trial at law.\"\n\nIn this class of cases an equitable remedy was invoked in aid of a purely legal right. \"There is no such thing as an equitable nuisance.\" Soltan v. De Held, 2 Sim. N. S. 151, 152. In other words, the plaintiff's right to equitable relief depended upon the existence of a legal title or right. And the court of equity therefore declined to take final action until the plaintiff's right had been established at law. See Lord Cottenham, Chancellor, in Harman v. Jones, 1 Cr.  Ph. 299, 301. That the plaintiff had the alleged legal right, and that the defendant's action had violated or was about to violate the right, were propositions indispensable to the granting of final equitable relief; and if either proposition was seriously disputed, it was required to be established at law. See 2 Dan Ch., 3d Am. ed., 1119. The practical result came about, that the question of fact was tried in the way in which a court of law tries disputed facts, i. e., by a jury. In all ordinary controversies of fact, it is a necessary incident to proceedings at law that there should be the verdict of a jury before judgment.\n\nThis practice of delaying final action in equity until after a trial at law was gradually changed in England by legislation subsequently to 1850. In that country there is, of course, no constitutional impediment to such legislation, and we refer to it merely as explanatory of some late English decisions founded on these modern statutes. But it is worthy of note, that even in England the pendulum is now swinging back the other way, and that very recent statutes and rules of court have gone far to restore the practice of trial by jury in this class of equity cases. For more than a century prior to that change, the testimony of judges and text-writers is overwhelming to the effect that the practice was what we have stated. The applicant for permanent equitable relief was bound to establish at law the fact that a nuisance existed, or was about to be created. \"This court,\" said Lord Cottenham, \"will not take upon itself to adjudicate upon the question of whether this is a nuisance\nor not: that must be ascertained in a court of law . . .\" Elmhirst v. Spencer, 2 Macn.  G. 45, 50, 51. \"The rule,\" said Lord Kingsdown, \"I take to be clearly this: If a plaintiff applies for an injunction to restrain a violation of a common-law right, if either the existence of the right or the fact of its violation be disputed, he must establish that right at law.\" Imp. Gas Co. v. Broadbent, 7 H. L. Cas. 600, 612.\n\nThe injunctive equity \"attaches only on an admitted or legally adjudged right in the plaintiff, admitted or legally adjudged to be infringed by the defendant. The existence of the right and the fact of its infringement must be tried, if disputed, in a court of law.\" Adams Eq. 217.\n\nThese English authorities as to the practice in such cases have been quoted with approval by this court, and have been followed in this state from the time equity jurisdiction was created, or restored, in 1832, down to the recent statute of 1885, of which we shall speak hereafter. See Parker, C. J., in Dover v. Portsmouth Bridge,  17 N.H. 200 ,  214 ; Coe v. Company,  37 N.H. 254 ,  263 ,  264 ; Burnham v. Kempton,  44 N.H. 78 ; Eastman v. Company,  47 N.H. 71 ; Perkins v. Foye,  60 N.H. 496 .\n\nIn New Hampshire, where the same judges presided both in equity and at law, the substantial reason for sending a case to be tried at law was, that the facts might be tried by jury. We have said, and we now reassert, that the authorities clearly show the practice to have been as we state it. But it is also true, that upon this subject, as upon every other subject, there are authorities which, upon a superficial examination, are open to misapprehension. It seems, therefore, desirable to call attention briefly to some distinctions, which, if kept in view, will prevent confusion.\n\nWe must bear in mind that courts of equity, though not granting final injunctions in such cases until after a jury trial, can and do grant temporary injunctions to preserve the property and prevent irreparable damage during the litigation. Because equity will not grant final relief until after a jury trial, it does not follow that equity will not take jurisdiction of the application before a jury trial has been had. On the contrary, a court of equity may take jurisdiction of such a case, grant a temporary injunction, retain the case on the equity docket to await the result of a trial at law, and then, if the plaintiff obtains a verdict at law, issue a permanent injunction. A hasty reading of some judicial opinions might give rise to misapprehensions. In discussing the propriety of granting an injunction, judges have not always stated in express terms which kind of injunction they were talking about &#8212; temporary, or final. Nor have they thought it necessary always to state that a court of equity's taking jurisdiction of a case does not necessarily imply that the court will finally decide for itself all questions of fact which may be deemed material to a final settlement of the controversy. But if we look to the actual motion before the court, we shall generally\nfind that in cases where there were disputed facts, and there had been no trial at law, the application was only for a temporary injunction. And we shall also find that the danger of irreparable mischief was not regarded as furnishing ground for the granting of final relief without a trial at law. It simply furnished a reason for granting a temporary injunction and retaining the bill to await the result of the trial at law, instead of turning the plaintiff completely out of the equity court. The correct doctrine is clearly stated in the opinion of this court in Burnham v. Kempton,  44 N.H. 97 . So the supreme court of the United States said, &#8212; \"The true distinction in this class of cases is, that in a prospect of immediate injury by what is apparently a nuisance, a temporary or preliminary injunction may at once issue, but not a permanent or perpetual one till the title, if disputed, is settled at law.\" Irwin v. Dixion 9 How. 10, 29; see, also. 28. On this subject we refer, also, to Gould Waters 694; Ad. Eq. 217, 218.\n\nThere are nuisance cases where final injunctions have been granted without any previous jury trial of the questions of fact; but the explanation is, that in those cases there were no disputed questions of fact for a jury to try. The facts were not in controversy, and the case either was too clear for argument, or else turned on a question of law which would not have been submitted to a jury even if the case had been pending in a court of law. Thus, in Lake Company v. Worster,  29 N.H. 433 , the bill was taken pro confesso, in consequence of the defendant's failure to file an answer. Hence there was no occasion to discuss the proper method of trying disputed questions of fact, or of establishing legal title. So Webber v. Gage,  39 N.H. 182 , came before the court with the facts admitted. The defendant there demurred to the bill, and the demurrer of course operated as an admission of all the plaintiff's material averments.\n\nAgain: In various cases where there was no formal admission, a comparison of the allegations of the bill and answer, or even the most superficial statement of the position of counsel, rendered it perfectly apparent that there was no serious dispute of fact in the case; it being clear either that there was no valid defence, or that the controversy turned entirely on matter of law, such as the construction or constitutionality of a statute, or the interpretation of a deed. Take, for instance, the often cited case of Gardner v. Newburgh. In that case Chancellor Kent said, &#8212; \"There is no need, from what at present appears, of sending the plaintiff to law to have his title first established.\" 2 Johns. Ch. 162, 165.\n\nWilcox v. Wheeler,  47 N.H. 488 , is an instance of a case where the defence set up in the answer raised no material question, except as to the legal construction of a deed. So in Woollen Mills v. Tillman 2 Barb. Ch. 9, 19, 20, the complainants claimed certain water rights \"under a recent conveyance from the defendant himself.\" Walworth, Chancellor, said, &#8212; \"It is only where the right of the\ncomplainant to the privilege claimed admits of doubt, that the court requires him to establish his right at law previous to the granting of an injunction. Here is no fact to be tried at law, to establish the right of the company to a participation in the use of the matters in question, in conformity with the terms of the grant from the defendant, except the simple fact of the due execution of the deed; as to which fact there is no question raised.\" And in Lyon v. McLaughlin,  32 Vt. 423 ,  426 , Barrett, J., said, \"In the present case there is no occasion to resort to a court of law for any purpose. The bill sets forth a clear right in the orators. The answer admits all the facts, but rests for defence on a question of construction only. That question can as well be determined in a proceeding in the court of chancery as in a court at law.\"\n\nSo, too, cases may occur where, although the facts are nominally. in dispute, the court can see that a certain result is inevitable, and that a verdict for the plaintiff would be ordered by the judge presiding at the trial. \"Where it is obvious that the finding of a jury can be in no other way but one;\" where the court is of opinion that, were the evidence offered by the defendant presented to a jury, they would not be justified in finding the fact to be as claimed by the defendant; or that they would be constrained by some presumption or other legal doctrine to find the fact as claimed by the plaintiff; &#8212; in these and like instances a court of equity will not send the cases to a court of law in order to go through the idle ceremony of having a foregone conclusion certified back. Where the fact is seriously disputed, and the court can see that it is a matter of doubt, the case will be sent to a court of law. But if it is conceded that all the evidence which can be supplied is already adduced in the cause, is already before the court, and the court is of the opinion that upon this evidence a jury would not be justified in sustaining the defence set up, then the court will not send the case to a jury merely in order to have a verdict ordered at the trial. Thus, in the wheeling Bridge Case, 13 How. 568, the fact that the bridge obstructed navigation was ascertained by measurements about which there could be no dispute. The height of the bridge, of the water, and of the chimneys of the steamboats, were facts not open to any real controversy. The court said, &#8212; \"If the obstruction exists, it is a nuisance. To ascertain this a jury is not necessary. It is shown in the report by a mathematical demonstration. . . . A jury in such a case could give no aid to the court nor security to the parties.\"\n\nFor the purposes of the present question, it is entirely immaterial whether the universal practice of courts of equity in 1792 was scientifically correct or not. It is immaterial whether the then existing practice was founded on legal truth or legal error. It is enough for the present purpose that it was the practice then prevailing in the courts.\n\nThus far we have been speaking of the English equity practice\nin 1792 in private equity suits for nuisance. We have now to consider the practice of the English court in public suits for nuisance, in bills in equity filed by the attorney-general. Instances of this proceeding were then rare; but it was the universal understanding, that, whenever this mode of procedure was resorted to, the disputed matters of fact must be tried by a jury before the granting of a permanent order of injunction or abatement.\n\nSo far we have been discussing this branch of the case as though there was no actual \"use and practice\" in New Hampshire in 1972, as to the method of trying the facts in a public proceeding to abate a nuisance; and we have been proceeding upon the supposition that the question whether a jury trial is to be allowed should be determined by looking at the then existing English chancery practice. And we think we have shown, by the highest possible testimony, that a jury trial would have then been requisite before a final decree could have been made by an English equity court.\n\nBut this inquiry into the English equity practice in cases of public nuisance was probably unnecessary. Even if it should be thought that Lord Eldon was mistaken, and that the practice in the court of chancery was exactly contrary to what the Lord Chancellor said it was, there is still a firm foundation on which we can rest our claim to a jury trial in this public proceeding. In this particular matter there undoubtedly was a settled \"use and practice\" in New Hampshire in 1792, and by that \"use and practice\" the questions of fact in public proceedings to abate nuisances were triable by jury. We had then no equity court, and hence no public equity suits to abate public nuisances. But we had the same thing in another form under another name. There was then, as now, a perfectly efficacious remedy at law for the abatement of public nuisance, viz., the remedy by indictment or information. In such a proceeding, judgment can be given for the abatement and removal of the nuisance. 1 Bish. Cr. L., 7th ed., s. 1079; 2 ib., s. 1285. Such a proceeding differs from the present proceeding (a bill in equity in the name of the attorney-general) only in name or form, and not in substance. The remedy by information, though criminal in form, is in substance a civil proceeding. Reg. v. Stephens L. R. 1 Q. B. 702, 708-710; 1 Bish. Cr. L., 7th ed., s. 1074.\n\nIn 1792, and for at least sixteen years prior thereto, there was no court competent to try the question of public nuisance without a jury; and, on the other hand, there was, during all that time, a court in which this question was triable by jury. How then can this question now be tried without the defendants' having a constitutional right to a jury? Those jurists who maintain that the constitution does not extend or enlarge the right of trial by jury, all admit that the constitution does at least preserve and guarantee this right in all controversies which it was the common practice to try by jury at the time of the adoption of the constitution.\n\nWe have been arguing that, even if there is no constitutional right of jury trial in equity causes in general, yet the case at bar stands on exceptional grounds and comes within the constitutional guaranty. We have contended that, although there may not be a constitutional right of jury trial in all equity cases, yet there is such a constitutional right in equity cases like the present. Now we propose to take a much broader ground, viz., that there is a constitutional right of jury trial in equity cases generally.\n\nThis question has been decided both ways by the courts of this state. There was no opportunity to raise the question until after the passage of the act of 1832, which was the first statute conferring general equity jurisdiction on our supreme court. That act was drawn by the late Hon. Joel Parker, and the question as to the right of a jury trial in equity was first raised when Judge Parker was chief justice, and was decided in an opinion given by him. In 1938, in Marston v. Brackett,  9 N.H. 336 ,  349 , it was held that a defendant in chancery has a constitutional right to have matters of fact tried by a jury. Nearly forty years later, in 1876, the contrary doctrine was held in Bellows v. Bellows,  58 N.H. 60 . In neither opinion is there any statement of reasons. The later opinion refers to and is supported by various dicta of Judge Ladd in 55 and 57 N.H., but it does not refer to any decision in point. In view of the immense importance of the question, the conflict of judicial decisions, and the absence of any authoritative statement of the argument in favor of the later doctrine, we have felt at liberty to argue the matter at the present time. The constitution has not, like the General Laws, been reenacted as a whole, either in 1877 or 1889, and hence there is no ground for arguing that this clause must necessarily bear the latest judicial construction.\n\nIt is due to Judge Ladd (who is my associate in this case) to say that he did not suggest raising this particular point in the present litigation. The point is presented by me on my own responsibility, after ascertaining from Judge Ladd that he does not make any personal objection to this course.\n\nThe New Hampshire constitutional guaranty of jury trial has sometimes been read backwards. To use a homely phrase, it has been \"turned t'other end to.\" The exception has been mistaken for the general rule, and the general rule has been mistaken for the exception. The 20th article of the Bill of Rights has been construed as if it read thus: \"There shall be no right of trial by jury except in cases where that mode of trial has heretofore been commonly practised.\" Such, however, is not the language of the constitution. That instrument, in effect, says that there shall be trial by jury in all cases, except those which it has heretofore been the custom to try without a jury. In other words, trial by jury is the rule, and trial without jury the exception. A litigant in New Hampshire, who claims that a particular controversy is triable without a jury, must establish the historical fact that it was the\npractice in New Hampshire, in 1792, to try such a controversy without a jury. On the other hand, the party claiming a jury trial need not show that it was the use and practice in New Hampshire, in 1792, to try such a controversy by jury. The burden is on the party denying the right, to show that it was the use and practice here at that time to try such a case without a jury. He cannot bring himself within the exception, by showing that in New Hampshire, at the time of the adoption of the constitution, the case now at bar could not have been tried at all, neither at law or equity; for, if the case were not then triable at all, it cannot be said that the practice and use were to try it without a jury. The case would fall within the general rule, and not within the exception.\n\nThe difference on this matter of jury trial between the New Hampshire constitution and the constitutions of most of the other states is very marked. Take, for instance, the constitution of New York: \"The trial by jury in all cases in which it has been heretofore used shall remain inviolate forever.\" As to such a provision, it may be true that it does not create nor enlarge the right of trial by jury; that it does not extend the right to cases not before within its operation. It simply retains and preserves it inviolate in those classes of cases in which it existed at the time of the adoption of the constitution. A clause almost identical with this New York provision was submitted to the people of New Hampshire in 1779, and disapproved. The constitution then submitted and rejected, contained the following clause: \"The right of trial by jury in all cases as heretofore used in this state, shall be preserved inviolate forever.\" 9 Prov. Pap. 838. But the present constitution of New Hampshire was framed with an entirely different purpose. It reads very differently from the rejected constitution of 1779. It was the obvious intention of the present constitution to provide for the right of jury trial in all future controversies and in respect to all rights of action which might thereafter be created, just as fully as in all controversies where a jury trial was then customary. The constitution was intended to provide for the future as well as for the present. With the exception of those cases which it was then the use and practice to dispose of without a jury, the constitution guarantees a jury trial as to all rights thereafter in dispute, whether those rights existed in 1792 under the common law and the statutes then in force, or arose afterwards from time to time out of subsequent legislation. All such rights, whether then existing or thereafter arising, would come under the protection of this constitutional guaranty.\n\nDo controversies triable in equity fall within the general rule, or within the exception? We will consider the exception fully; &#8212; but first let us ask, How would the case stand if there were no clause of exception? The language of the general rule is exceeding broad: \"All controversies concerning property,\" and \"all suits between\ntwo or more persons.\" These words were carefully chosen as describing and including all possible litigation of a civil nature, &#8212; proceedings in rem as well as proceedings in personam. A private suit in equity is generally a controversy concerning a right of property; and it is always a suit between two or more persons. See 7 Pick. 368. If is framers of the constitution of 1792 had intended to guarantee the right only in suits at common law, they would naturally have expressed that meaning in distinct language. They would have copied the 7th amendment to the constitution of the United States, which reads thus: \"In suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved,\" c. This amendment was proposed by the first U.S. congress in 1789, and had just been adopted by the state legislatures. It must have been well known to the members of the New Hampshire constitutional convention, which met less than three years thereafter.\n\nPlace the two provisions in parallel columns, and let any man say whether the general rule in the New Hampshire constitution does not have a far wider range than the carefully limited language of the Federal constitution:\n\n   Amendment to U.S. constitution,       New Hampshire constitution, Art. VII:                              Bill of Rights, Art. XX: \"In suits at common-law . . .          \"In all controversies concerning the right of trial by jury shall be    property, and all suits between preserved. . .\"                        two or more persons, . . . the parties have a right to trial by jury . . .\" \n\nSo much for the construction which would be put upon the New Hampshire constitution, if the general rule stood alone, without the exception. And, by the way, we ought to mark the fact (stated by counsel in  142 Mass. 174 ) that in the convention framing the Massachusetts constitution, from which New Hampshire copied the substance of this provision, the first draft introduced entirely omitted the excepting clause, which was afterwards added by the committee. (Jour. Con. 1779-'80, 152, cited in  142 Mass. 174 .)\n\nThe next question is, Does the exception include cases in equity? Note, at the outset, that there is no ground for putting any forced construction on the language of this exception. There is no room to argue that the exception will be meaningless or totally ineffectual, unless it shall be construed as including cases in equity. The exception has ample force and application in other directions. Without enumerating all the matters which fall within its scope, it is sufficient now to allude to probate causes as admittedly coming under it. Nor is there any reason to suppose that the people of 1792 entertained a prejudice against trial by jury, and must therefore have intended this seemingly narrow exception to have an\nunnaturally wide scope. Such a supposition would be contradicted by the most solemn declarations of that generation. One of the grievances against the British crown, enumerated in the Declaration of Independence, was \"for depriving us in many cases of the benefits of trial by jury.\" And in the constitution of 1792, the very next article to the one now under consideration speaks of \"the inestimable privilege of trial by jury.\" See, also, the observations of Ladd, J.,  57 N.H. 79 . Our construction of the exception is, that it refers to the use and practice existing in New Hampshire in 1792, &#8212; not to the use and practice existing in some other jurisdiction in 1792, nor to the use and practice existing in New Hampshire at some antecedent date.\n\nIf this construction be correct (and we shall have something to say on that head by and by), the next question is, whether equity cases were among the cases which it was the practice in New Hampshire in 1792 to try without a jury. The answer to this historical question does not admit of doubt. Equity causes were not tried without a jury in New Hampshire in 1792, for they were not then triable at all in this state. The statute book shows that the last semblance of an equity court was abolished in 1776. If any court ever had equity jurisdiction, it was the old court of appeals, composed of the governor and council. This court was abolished June 28, 1776. (See  57 N.H. 67 , and 1 Farmer's Belknap 368.) There had therefore been no possibility of trying equity causes in New Hampshire for sixteen years prior to the adoption of the constitution. And it is an historical fact, proved by the independent investigations of two competent lawyers, that there had been no actual exercise of equity jurisdiction in New Hampshire for at least half a century prior to 1792. We may add, that in our belief there had been no exercise of such jurisdiction for a much longer period.\n\nSo far as we are aware, no instance has been cited of the actual exercise of chancery jurisdiction in New Hampshire later than the year 1700. In the seventeenth century there was something of the sort. Robert Mason is understood to have been appointed chancellor, and bills in equity were heard before him. 1 Prov. Pap. 474, 502, 503. Later, in 1692, an act was passed giving equity jurisdiction to the governor and council, who composed the court of appeals, and constituting them a \"high court of chancery.\" See 27 N.H. 512 . But, so far as we know, there is no evidence that this jurisdiction was ever exercised after the year 1700, if indeed to so late a date as that. The latest document we have seen from which it could be inferred that chancery jurisdiction was actually exercised, is a letter from the Lords Commissioners for Trade and Plantations to the Earl of Bellomont, dated April 20, 1701. 2 Prov. Pap. 342. This letter refers to \"diverse complaints of irregularities of the courts of chancery in his Majesty's Plantations.\" But inasmuch as Bellomont was governor of other\nprovinces besides New Hampshire (1 Farmer's Belknap 153), the complaint may have had regard to what took place in another province (e. g., New York); and, at all events, the complaint probably related to facts transpiring not later than the year 1700. The name \"court of chancery\" was undoubtedly used in New Hampshire at dates subsequent to 1700. Thus, the provincial house of representatives, in 1727-'28, makes mention of \"the court, sometimes called a court of appeals, and sometimes the court of chancery.\"  57 N.H. 64 . And Mr. Shirley says that the records of the governor and council \"were indifferently termed the records of the court of appeals and of the court of chancery.\"  57 N.H. 60 . But the material question here is, not how long the governor and council continued to be styled a court of chancery, but how long did they actually exercise chancery jurisdiction. The actual use and practice is the essential point of inquiry.\n\nJudge Bell, in  27 N.H. 512 , says, &#8212; \"It is supposed that the governor and council, who composed the court of appeals, continued to exercise chancery powers till the Revolution.\" But this \"supposition\" is the exact opposite of the actual fact. As to the long period from 1742 to the Revolution, we have positive knowledge that the governor and council did not exercise chancery powers. Their records during that period are extant. These records, from 1742 to 1774, have been examined by two New Hampshire lawyers, each investigating independently of the other. The result of both investigations is, that during this period there were no equity causes (in the proper sense of that term) heard before that tribunal. The two lawyers referred to are our recently deceased brother, John M. Shirley, Esq., and the late Chief-Justice Smith. Mr. Shirley's very explicit testimony is given in his argument in Perkins v. Scott,  57 N.H. 60 . Chief-Justice Smith appears to have made an abstract of all noteworthy causes heard before the governor and council during those years; and these abstracts were recorded by him in a volume which is now in my possession, and which is at the service of the plaintiffs' counsel and of the court. There is just one case (Rex v. Sherburne, 7 MS. Rep. 131; MS. Dig. 259, s. 4; 136b) in reference to which the word \"equity\" is applied by Judge Smith in his index; but the slightest examination of his abstract shows that it was not an equity case in the proper sense at all, and also shows how he came to apply that term to it. It was a suit to enforce a preference in favor of the crown, in collecting a debt alleged to be due the crown from the insolvent estate of a deceased person; a claim which would have been cognizable on the so called \"equity side\" of the court of exchequer in England. 3 Black Com. 44-46. The suit was not brought before the governor and council in the first instance (as a chancery case must have been); but was originally brought before the superior court, on the theory that that court had the same jurisdiction in respect to demands due the crown as the court of exchequer\nhad in England. The case was tried by jury in the superior court, and then taken before the governor and council on appeal, just as any other case might have been. Mr. Shirley also examined the records of the governor and council from 1699 to 1716, and found a total absence of chancery proceedings. He also notes the fact that the chancery court attempted to be established in Massachusetts in 1692 never exercised chancery jurisdiction. In those days New Hampshire largely followed the lead of the more populous and wealthy province on its southern border. It seems exceedingly improbable that a court of equity was kept in active existence here for a century after it ceased to exist in Massachusetts. See  57 N.H. 68 ,  69 .\n\nBut this is not all. There is still more evidence to show that the chancery jurisdiction of the governor and council, if not in terms abolished, had become so entirely obsolete that nobody supposed it to be capable of exercise. In 1773 a committee of the English privy council reported that no court of chancery existed in New Hampshire. 2 Belknap 279, ed. of 1812; 1 Farmer's Belknap 347. And the governor and council themselves, the very next year, seemed to have practically affirmed the same doctrine. It must be remembered that if that tribunal had any equity jurisdiction, it was original jurisdiction. No other kind of equity jurisdiction was attempted to be conferred on them by the act of 1692. Yet they held in 1774 that they had no original jurisdiction of any kind whatever. At the May term, 1774, in George Wentworth's Case (a request to issue a mandate to the superior court), the governor and council decided that \"this court have no jurisdiction of any causes but such as are brought before them by appeal.\" See statement in  57 N.H. 64 , and also in 7 MS. Rep. 145; &#8212; see, also, Mr. Shirley's statement of the case of Livius v. Moffatt, in 1768-'69;  57 N.H. 63 ,  64 .\n\nHow thoroughly obsolete the nominal chancery jurisdiction had become is apparent from the circumstance that the ablest lawyers of the generation immediately following the Revolution were totally ignorant of the fact that any attempt had ever been made in New Hampshire to exercise such jurisdiction. Hon. Samuel Bell, judge and governor, was certainly one of the leading members of the bar of that day. In his gubernatorial message to the legislature in 1821, he said, &#8212; \"Our ancestors, who adopted in general the laws of that country from which they originated as a basis of their code, omitted to introduce into practice that part of the system which appertains to chancery jurisdiction.\" Up to the delivery of the opinion of Governor Bell's son (the late Judge Samuel D. Bell) in 1853, in the case of Wells v. Pierce, we are not aware that anybody had ever advanced a different opinion from that expressed by Governor Bell in his message in 1821, which we have just quoted.\n\nThe learned author of Dane's Abridgment, published in 1824,\nsays (vol. 7, 516) that \"the equity or chancery system of England . . . has ever been almost wholly excluded from New England and Pennsylvania.\" So far, he says, \"as any powers in equity have ever been exercised in these colonies and states, they have been sparingly granted in a very few cases by their several legislatures to their courts of law.\" Again, p. 518, he says that the early settlers were not much disposed to establish a code of equity distinct from common law; and that in New England nothing was done \"but only to vest in the law courts, with jealousy and by little and little, powers in equity to soften the unyielding spirit of the law.\" So Bellows, J.,  45 N.H. 336 , says that in New England \"courts of chancery have been, until a comparatively recent period, regarded with jealousy.\"\n\nThe foregoing historical facts, as to the non-exercise of equity jurisdiction in New Hampshire, render it very clear that equity causes do not fall within the exception to the constitutional guaranty of jury trial, unless that exception is to receive a very singular interpretation. In order to bring equity cases within its terms, it is necessary to contend that the phrase \"heretofore otherwise used and practised\" refers to practice in some jurisdiction other than New Hampshire; or else that it refers to a former practice in New Hampshire which had entirely ceased long before the adoption of the constitution. Neither of these interpretations is tenable. There can be no reasonable doubt as to the when and the where, the time and the place, alluded to in the words \"heretofore otherwise used and practised.\" The place of practice was New Hampshire, not New York or England. The time of practice was the date when the constitution was submitted for adoption, not a date fifty or a hundred years anterior. As to place, the natural construction of the exception would refer it to the local practice in New Hampshire. Any construction which refers it to the practice in England, or to the practice in other states of the Union, would involve serious difficulties. Suppose, for instance, that in a particular kind of controversy trial by jury had been practised in New Hampshire, but that in England it had been the practice to try that class of cases without a jury: now if the exception of cases \"heretofore otherwise used and practised\" refers to and includes the English practice, this case falls within the exception, and the constitution does not guarantee a jury trial. The effect is, that a citizen of New Hampshire may be constitutionally deprived of a jury trial, although such a mode of trial was invariably enjoyed in New Hampshire in this class of cases up to the very moment of the adoption of the constitution; in other words, the constitution reduces New Hampshire to the English level.\n\nEqually strong objections exist to construing the exception as referring to the practice in other states of the Union. Upon that construction, the rule would be swallowed up in the exception. It has been said, and we think with considerable truth, that this\nconstruction \"would deny to the defendant his right of jury trial in almost every case.\" There was then great \"diversity of practice\" among the different states as to trial by jury. Some states denied it in one case, and some in another. To except from the constitutional guaranty all the cases in which the right had ever been denied in any state might have resulted in leaving few, or no, cases to come within the operation of the general guaranty. In the Massachusetts convention of 1788, while debating the adoption of the Federal constitution, a wish was expressed to insert in that constitution a provision for jury trial with an exception similar to that we are now considering. But to this it was answered, that \"the exception of all cases where a jury have not heretofore been used would include almost all cases that could be mentioned, when applied to all the states, for they have severally differed in the kinds of causes which they have tried without a jury.\" 2 Elliott's Debates 114. So in the Federal convention of 1787, when it was proposed to provide that \"trial by jury shall be preserved as usual in civil cases,\" the objection was raised that trial by jury \"is usual in different cases in different states.\" 5 Elliott's Debates 550.\n\nBut this 20th article of the Bill of Rights contains internal evidence, of the most conclusive description, that the practice intended to be referred to is the practice of New Hampshire, and not the practice of England or of New York. This article gives power to the legislature hereafter to dispense with a jury, if it sees fit, \"in cases arising on the high seas and such as relate to mariners' wages.\" Of course, therefore, the framers of the constitution did not understand that these admiralty cases were already excepted under the words \"cases heretofore otherwise used and practised.\" But they would have been so excepted if the exception had been intended to refer to the practice then existing in England, and not to the practice then existing in New Hampshire. At that time it was the practice to try admiralty cases without a jury in England, and in some of the United States (1 Kent Com. 372, 376); but it was the practice in New Hampshire to try this class of cases by jury. Does not this reference to admiralty cases, as coming within the constitutional guaranty and not within the exception, clearly prove that the framers of the constitution meant to except only those cases which it was the New Hampshire practice to try without a jury, &#8212; not those cases which it was the English practice to try without a jury? If admiralty cases were understood to fall within the exception, then the power specially given to the legislature to dispense with a jury in such cases was entirely superfluous.\n\nThe time, or date, of the practice referred to in the exception is as unmistakable as the place of the practice. \"Heretofore\" means \"at and immediately preceding\" the time of adopting the constitution. It does not refer to a practice which had then been completely disused for at least half a century; a practice which\nhad become so completely obsolete that the ablest lawyers of the day were not aware that it had ever existed. In 7 Pick. 368, Parker, C. J., said, as to this point, under the Massachusetts constitution, &#8212; \"We are inclined to think that the word `heretofore,' in the exception, could hardly be applicable to a practice which had ceased to exist nearly a century before the constitution was adopted.\"\n\nThere is a direct decision of this court to the point that this clause looks to the practice at the time of the adoption of the constitution, and not to the practice at any previous date. This was the ratio decidendi in Baker v. Holderness,  26 N.H. 110 ,  114 . The controversy there in question was one of a class which had been tried by jury up to the year 1786, and tried without a jury from 1786 to 1792. It was held, that the constitution did not guarantee the right of jury trial in such a cases inasmuch as at the time of the adoption of the constitution it was the use and practice to try such a case without a jury. The test adopted was the practice existing in 1792, and not the practice in 1785 and for many years before that date. (Whether the practice of dispensing with a jury in that class of controversies from 1786 to 1792 was or was not a violation of the Constitution of 1784, is a matter which does not concern our present inquiry.)\n\nThe same test which was applied in Baker v. Holderness was also applied (with the opposite practical result) in Copp v. Henniker,  55 N.H. 179 ,  191 , 192 . We are aware that this case has recently been overruled; but the reversal was not placed upon a ground which throws any doubt upon the particular reasoning for which we now cite that opinion. Ladd, J., there said, that if the practice up to 1786 was to try a particular class of cases without a jury, and that practice was changed in 1786 so as to try such cases with a jury, and this latter practice continued from 1786 to 1792, then the constitution of 1792 guarantees the right of jury trial in that class of cases. He expressly says that \"the right to a trial by jury, existing in this class of cases from 1786 to the adoption of the constitution, does not leave this class among the cases in which it has been `heretofore otherwise used and practised,' but shows it to be among the cases in which this mode of procedure is to be held sacred.\" In a word, the test is the practice in 1792, and not the practice from 1719 to 1786.\n\nIf we are to adopt the other construction, &#8212; if we are to say that the phrase \"heretofore otherwise used and practised,\" instead of being confined to the practice existing in 1792, refers to and includes any practice which had ever prevailed, at any time, from the first settlement in 1623, &#8212; then what is to hinder the legislature, today, from enacting that in all important cases there shall be a right of appeal from the jury courts to a higher tribunal, and that all questions of fact shall be decided in this appellate court without a jury? Such was the law and practice for nearly a century prior to 1776.\nIf the exception in the constitution is not limited to the practice in 1792, but includes all cases which there was ever at any previous time a practice to try without jury, why does not the constitution permit the legislature to resuscitate the old court of appeals, or create a new judicial tribunal equivalent thereto? Of course, no sane man supposes that the constitution intended to permit any such performance, but we put the case as a redutio ad absurdum of the theory we are combating. The true doctrine is that endorsed by Foster, J., in King v. Hopkins,  57 N.H. 334 , 355 : \". . . that the repeal of the right of appeal to the governor and to the king at the beginning of the Revolution, and the continued abolition of such appeals from 1776 to 1792, leaves the constitution to be construed as if no such right of appeal had ever existed.\" By parity of reasoning, it would seem that the abolition in 1776 (if not earlier) of a merely nominal court of chancery ought to leave the constitution to be construed as if no such court had ever existed.\n\nIt is said by Judge Bell, in  27 N.H. 512 , that \"Equity, as a great branch of the law of their native country, was brought over by the colonists, and has always existed as part of the common law in its broadest sense in New Hampshire.\" There is a sense in which this statement is true, and another sense in which it is not true. There is an obvious distinction between principle and procedure. Those principles of equity which can be completely adopted and carried into execution by a court of common law, are, and always have been, part of the common law of New Hampshire. But the peculiar procedure of equity was not part of the common law of New Hampshire at the time of the adoption of the constitution, and cannot now be made so, except so far as this procedure is consistent with constitutional provisions. Equity procedure can be introduced by the legislature only in subordination to the constitution; not as a superior external force, suspending or overriding that instrument. The generation which adopted the constitution was not enthusiastically in favor of establishing a court of equity, even under the most explicit constitutional restrictions. Among the amendments proposed in 1791-'92 was one (No. 57) providing for the establishment of a court of equity. This amendment was accompanied by an express proviso that \"no power shall be granted to any such court incompatible with the Bill of Rights and constitution,\" and was prefaced by a hint that the establishment of a court of equity might serve the purpose of leaving no excuse for legislative or executive usurpation of judicial functions. The amendment, in full, was as follows: \"For the more effectually preserving the proper separation of the three great powers of government, agreeably to the 37th article in the Bill of Rights, the power of hearing and deciding in causes of equity shall be vested either in some judicial court or courts, or in some court to be established specially for that purpose: Provided, no power shall be granted to any such courts incompatible with the Bill of Rights\nand constitution; and the powers of said courts shall be limited and defined by express laws, &#8212; and no suit in equity shall be sustained where clear and adequate remedy may be had at law.\" But the proposed amendment, though thus carefully guarded, was not adopted. It failed to receive a two-thirds vote (1883 yes, 1340 no). 10 Prov. Pap. 123, 124, 142. This rejected amendment required the establishment of a court of equity, or the conferring of equity powers on existing courts. Notwithstanding its rejection, the legislature was undoubtedly left at liberty thereafter to establish a court of equity, which should proceed in conformity with the constitution. But there is no sufficient evidence to justify the belief that the people intended to leave the legislature at liberty to establish an equity practice which should be in direct violation of important constitutional provisions.\n\nEverything that is peculiarly desirable in a court of chancery \"may be obtained without violating the constitution.\" See argument of Richard Fletcher, 7 Pick. 366. \". . . a reasonable construction\" of the constitutional provision \"does not require that a suit in chancery shall be tried just as a suit at common law would be, and . . . there is no necessity that the whole case shall be put to the jury. The most that can be made of the article is, that all controverted facts deemed essential to the fair and full trial of the case shall be passed upon by the jury, if the parties or either of them require it. And whether the facts proposed to be so tried are essential or not, must of necessity be determined by the court. There may be many facts stated in a bill and denied in an answer, and also facts alleged in the answer, which are wholly immaterial to the merits of the case, and such facts the court may refuse to put to the jury; just as in an action at common law, if a party offers to prove facts which are irrelevant, the court may reject the proof, &#8212; and as immaterial issues, even after verdict, may be rejected as nugatory. The right of the party to go to the jury is preserved, if he is allowed that course in regard to all such facts as have a bearing upon the issue for trial.\" Parker, C. J., 7 Pick. 368.\n\nCertain constitutional provisions have received a judicial construction, which gives them a wider application than some of the framers of the constitution may have anticipated. In applying or expounding a general principle, courts have sometimes held that the fathers \"builded better than they knew.\" But this method of interpretation cannot avail the present plaintiffs. For, if any such broad method of interpretation is to be applied here, it must be applied to the general constitutional guaranty of jury trial, and not to the exception of \"cases heretofore otherwise used and practised.\" The former is a broad general rule or principle, clearly intended to have a wide scope. The latter is concerned only with a matter of fact. The ultimate limit of this exception is to be found, not in the inherent, expansive power of a general principle, but within the narrow confines of an historical fact.\n\nEdgar Aldrich, for the plaintiffs, orally. The bill, as originally drawn and as amended, presents several distinct and different grounds of equitable jurisdiction, and several distinct and different reasons why equitable relief should be granted. There were no allegations of nuisance in the bill as originally drawn, and as amended there is no allegation of a public nuisance. The allegation that the plaintiffs are members of the public is merely for the purpose of stating their title, &#8212; in other words, for the purpose of stating their right to use the water of the Connecticut river. The only allegation as to nuisance is the following: \"And now [March 6, 1888] the plaintiffs further say, that the acts and purposes complained of have been completed, and the defendants have constructed a dam of the character described, which is a nuisance, and should be abated.\" And the prayer was amended so as to call for abatement or for a regulation of the right of use, as equity might require. The allegation of nuisance was merely adding a distinct and independent ground for equitable relief.\n\nThereupon the defendants say by demurrer, &#8212; \"The defendants say that the plaintiffs' bill aforesaid does not show ground for the relief prayed for; and, as one cause of demurrer thereto, they specify and point out the allegations in said bill contained, which show that the right therein supposed and charged to be infringed by the defendants is alleged to be a public right in the use of the Connecticut river, and the grievance therein set forth and charged is the maintenance of a public nuisance, for the abatement whereof a bill in equity, at the suit of a private person, cannot by the laws of the land be maintained.\" So it will be seen upon examination that the demurrer assumes what the bill does not, in fact, set forth as to the character of the nuisance and the character of the right.\n\nFollowing this, the plaintiffs, as a matter of precaution, upon leave, joined the attorney-general. Now, suppose the allegation of nuisance is waived or stricken out: there still remain allegations which make a case for equitable cognizance. Or, suppose the demurrer is sustained as to the public character of the nuisance: it is the same. Upon a hearing, the use of the water may be regulated without trying the question of nuisance either by court or jury, because there is other merit in the bill. It seems to me that we are all unreasonably exerting ourselves to jump the bridge before we get to it. \"Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof;\" I submit that the case presented sets forth one of the most plain and common grounds for equitable interference, and one of the oldest known to equity jurisprudence, namely, the regulation of the use of water in which the parties have a conceded common right and title.\n\nIt will be seen further on, that courts of equity from time immemorial in England, and in this country as long as courts of equity have been known, have regulated such use without the allegation\nor proof of nuisance, and in innumerable instances have tried and determined the question of nuisance when there were other grounds for equitable jurisdiction in the bill, and in a vast number of instances have tried and determined the question of water rights and of nuisance as an independent question. The question of nuisance, when you get to it, might be so plain that the court would say, There can be no serious controversy or disputed fact here: or the peril to life and property might be so imminent as to warrant the interference of the court, and, from its inherent common-law power, might warrant an order for its removal.\n\nExtravagant suppositions are sometimes valuable as illustrations. Suppose an obstruction is erected across a river at the outskirts of a city, and it; is plain and indisputable that it is unwarrantable, unnecessary, and a nuisance, and it is known that an irresistible flood ten hours away is approaching, and, upon encountering this obstruction, unless a passage-way is given, will be stayed just enough to give it uncontrollable force, and, as it breaks and passes on, a hundred thousand lives and millions of property may be destroyed, &#8212; and a petition is filed for relief: would it be claimed that you must first try this question of right &#8212; of nuisance &#8212; by jury? \"There are nuisance cases where final injunctions have been granted without any previous jury trial of the questions of fact; but the explanation is, that in those cases there were no disputed questions of fact for a jury to try. The facts were not in controversy, and the case either was too clear for argument, or else turned on a question of law which would not have been submitted even if the case had been pending in a court of law.\"\n\nI am aware of the great number of cases where it is said that the right must be plain, or the evidence clear and positive, or the right must be first established at law, and I shall claim further on that the case at bar is not of that class; for the right and title of the parties are conceded, and established, for the purpose of equitable jurisdiction, and the relief sought mere]y relates to the manner of the exercise of the rights. If there were a question of title, &#8212; if the plaintiffs' rights were in dispute, whether the water belonged to him (as in Burnham v. Kempton,  44 N.H. 100 ), &#8212; this right would doubtless have to be determined at law, unless it were a clear case of imminent peril or of threatened irreparable injury, and other exceptions, perhaps.\n\nNow we come to the case in hand. What is it? The plaintiffs say, &#8212; (1) That the Connecticut river is a public highway. This is true as a matter of law, and it is conceded to be such by the defendants, and is therefore established. So there is no legal right in controversy as to that phase of the case. (2) It is alleged that the plaintiffs, as a member of the public, have a right to use the same for purposes of navigation. This is conceded by the defendants, and therefore established. This was also conceded in the oral argument. So there is no question of right or title here.\n(3) It is claimed, on the other hand, that the defendants, as riparian owners, have a right to use the water. This is conceded &#8212; therefore not in controversy; that is to say, there is no question of fact as to the defendants' right to use the water in question. By the answer, certain extraordinary powers of control are claimed. Upon these questions there is controversy; but they involve law, not fact. If there were an open and disputed question as to whether the Connecticut river were a public highway, and if the plaintiffs' right as a member of the public to use such river for purposes of navigation were in dispute; or, if the plaintiffs claimed to own land adjoining a river not navigable, and so had a right to use the water, and their title was in dispute, &#8212; quite likely such questions of disputed rights would have to be settled at law before a court of equity would interfere. But, as I have said, all these questions of right are not in dispute, but are conceded.\n\nThe defendants claim, as a matter of law, that the rights of the parties are equal. This is a question of law, and not of fact. We claim that the superior right is in the member of the public having occasion to use a natural highway for purposes of navigation. One is a natural right, while the other is an acquired right. The right of the riparian owner is subject to the right of navigation. But of course each right must be exercised in a manner reasonable to the other, having reference to the importance and the nature of the business of each. This is a question which arises after trial of the facts. See Coul.  F. Wat. 33; Wood Nuis. 86, 93; People v. Vanderbilt,  28 N.Y. 396 ; Jolly v. Terre Haute Co., 6 McLean 237; Ins. Co. v. Curtenius, ib. 209. It would also seem that the legislature, granting the Mills-Olcott charter in 1807, had in view the superior right of navigation, because by s. 7 of the act it is provided that nothing therein \"shall authorize the erection of any dam across said river so as to prevent the free passage of lumber down Connecticut river as heretofore used and enjoyed.\" While we concede that each right must be exercised reasonably with reference to the other, still we claim that upon the question of reasonableness, the question of the first superior right is to be considered.\n\nNow, what is in controversy here? There is no question of right and title, as I have said. The simple question is, whether the right of one is exercised reasonably with respect to the other; and, in short, the plaintiffs say that the use the defendants put upon the water makes it difficult for the plaintiffs to do business. And this, of course, is a question as to manner. Now, what would be reasonable one year would not be reasonable another. What would be reasonable one day might not be reasonable the next, because the reasonableness is ever varying with the changes in the height of the water. In times of high water it might be reasonable for both to use the river at the same time; while at an ordinary pitch of the water the draught which the defendants\nmake through their canal, carrying the water out of New Hampshire and discharging it below the falls, at the same time running the mill on the New Hampshire side, might operate as an absolute destruction of the plaintiffs' enterprise.\n\nWhat distinct question would you submit to a jury? The right and title not being in controversy, would you ask a jury to find whether the defendants should run both their mills in low water or in high water? How would you submit such a question to a jury, and what good would such a finding do? There would need to be some order regulating the use. Would you ask the jury to find the height of the dam? There is no necessity for this, as said in the Wheeling Bridge Case, 13 How. 568: the height is not reasonably in controversy; it can be ascertained by measurement Would you ask them to find whether there is a sluice-way? There is no occasion for that, because it shows for itself. Would you ask them to pass upon the reasonableness of the one there, if there be one? This would not necessarily determine the manner of use, because what would be reasonable for one season might not be reasonable for another season.\n\nThe question of right and title being out of the controversy, how is it possible to regulate and establish the manner in which this water shall be used, except by an order of court reaching to the future? Such an order would, of course, be open to modification and change, as future exigencies or developments might demand. The plaintiffs say, as one ground for relief, that the damages resulting from the defendants' use would be irreparable. They say, also, that it would require a multiplicity of suits to define the manner in which this water should be used under varying circumstances.\n\nAs we have before contended, it is the peculiar province of courts of equity to determine such questions, and that such rights have been regulated in equity for a very long time. We shall only submit two or three authorities in this connection, but shall refer to this branch of the case again further on. Indeed, we need not go outside of our own jurisdiction. Judge Sargent, in Burnham v. Kempton,  44 N.H. 100 , uses the following language: \"Courts of equity have jurisdiction of that class of cases where there is an admitted common right, among several owners of the same privilege, to regulate the common uses, to determine the extent of their respective rights and the proper mode of exercising and enjoying them, as tending to prevent litigation and as affording a more complete and perfect remedy than could be obtained at law, and as furnishing, in fact, the only adequate means of ascertaining and determining the respective rights of the parties.\"\n\nThe ground on which relief was refused in that case was, that the defendant's right was disputed altogether. It was not claimed that he had any title, unless it came by user. This was denied. The suggestion of Judge Sargent was to the effect that if his title\nwas not in controversy, relief would follow as familiar equity. This broad proposition, it will be seen further on, is abundantly supported by the best authority here and in England. \"Another ground of equity jurisdiction is the regulation of common rights in water.\" Gould Waters, s. 540. In Lyon v. McLaughlin,  32 Vt. 424 , Judge Barrett says, &#8212; \"It is agreed that both parties have rights to the privilege of water under their respective deeds.\" So far it is like the case at bar, because it is conceded that both parties have a right to use the water of the Connecticut. The holding is as follows: \"When the invasion of a right in the use of a water-course is threatened and intended, which is necessarily to be continuing and operative prospectively and indefinitely, and the extent of the injurious consequences is contingent and doubtful of estimation, the appropriate remedy is by a bill in chancery praying for an injunction against such invasion, on the ground that it will cause irreparable injury to the orator. The uncertainty of the extent of the prospective injury, and the impossibility of ascertaining the measure of just reparation, render such injury irreparable in a legal sense; and therefore courts of equity will entertain jurisdiction of such a bill, and grant the proper remedy, notwithstanding the respective rights of the parties to the use of the water are in dispute, and depend entirely upon the legal construction of their title deeds. . . . The case discloses that the parties have rights in common to the use and enjoyment of the water-privilege created by said dam. They are in controversy as to the character and extent of their respective rights, and as to the proper mode of exercising and enjoying them. This relation of the rights of the parties in reference to the subject-matter of it is the ground of a familiar head of equity jurisdiction, as furnishing the only adequate means of ascertaining the respective rights of the parties, and of affording an ample remedy between them.\" See, also, Ang. Wat., s. 444, et seq.\n\nBelknap v. Trimble, 3 Paige 601, is to the effect that \"when several mill-owners have a common right to an artificial use of water for their respective mills, a court of chancery has jurisdiction so to regulate the common use of the water as to preserve the rights of each. That is, where the rights are established or admitted, the use may be regulated by a court of chancery.\" Webber v. Gage,  39 N.H. 182 , is still stronger. In Bemis v. Upham, 13 Pick. 170, the opinion was by the late Chief-Justice Shaw, in the course of which the learned judge says, under the statute of 1827, &#8212; \"The statute authorizes the court to hear and determine in equity any matter touching waste or nuisance in which there is not a plain, adequate, and complete remedy at law.\" This statute it may be observed in passing, is similar to our statute of 1867. But I assert here that these statutes were quite unnecessary, for the reason that waste and nuisance are matters over which courts of equity have exercised control from the earliest English equity period.\n\nChief-Justice Shaw, after alluding to the inadequacy of legal remedies, and the difficulty of regulating the rights at law, and the hardships that might follow an absolute abatement if it were found to be a nuisance, uses the following strong and powerful reasoning &#8212; \"whereas, a decree in equity can extend to all parties having an interest and bind them, and it may be effectual and perpetual. Instead of requiring an entire prostration of the nuisance, it may be modified and adapted to the just rights of the parties; it may order an abatement in part, determine the height to which the dam may be kept, the terms on which it may be kept up, the mode of using the water, and other incidents, and thus it may be more beneficial for both parties than a mere and absolute abatement.\"\n\nThe case of Bardwell v. Ames, 22 Pick. 353, is valuable in this connection. That was a case arising on the Connecticut river at South Hadley falls, and it was conceded that the parties both had rights in the water, but the extent and limit of the rights were in dispute. The court say, &#8212; \"Indeed, it appears to us that the proceeding in equity is peculiarly fitted to ascertain, settle, and adjust the relative rights and obligations of the parties so situated, and to secure and enforce them, and that an action at law which could only look to the past and inquire into damages actually sustained, and for these could only award a sum of money, without protection of the right for the future, would be neither adequate in its nature nor complete in its effects.\"\n\nSo we say the case is one cognizable in equity, whether the obstruction is distinctly found to be a nuisance or not. Yet we must insist that the allegation of nuisance does not oust the court of jurisdiction; that the case should proceed in the ordinary way. When it is reached by the trier, the question of nuisance may be so plain and palpable to the plaintiffs that the court may say it is not reasonably in dispute, and therefore not for the jury. It may be found to be in that class of cases referred to by Judge Smith in his argument, where from the very nature of things no serious controversy of fact can exist. Or the court may say it is so plain and palpable for the defendants that it is not reasonably in dispute, and therefore not for the jury; or, again, if the case does not turn on other points, the court may say as a matter of discretion, not as a constitutional right (Bellows v. Bellows,  58 N.H. 60 ), after hearing the evidence and seeing the situation, that this particular issue as to nuisance is not so seriously in controversy that it should be determined by a jury; or, again, if the use should be rightfully regulated on grounds other than nuisance, or if the particular issue of nuisance should be sent to a jury as discretion, or if that issue should be deemed plainly against the plaintiffs without a jury, then it is reasonable to assume that the defendants would not complain of outraged justice. The time to meet this question of right of trial by jury is when it is denied, not before. That question\ncannot reasonably be determined at this stage of the proceedings. Moreover, it is a question to be determined by the court at the trial term. Dole v. Pike,  64 N.H. 22 ; Davis v. Dyer,  62 N.H. 231 .\n\nAlthough it is not necessary that the obstruction be found as a matter of fact to be a nuisance, in order that the rights of use in question be regulated, inasmuch as the learned counsel have given the constitutional question of right of trial by jury in equity causes such prominence in argument, both by brief and orally, &#8212; the question being treated as of such immense importance, as he puts it, in his argument, &#8212; we shall invite the attention of the court to some considerations upon that branch of the case. But, indeed, I may say here, that if all that has been said, since Marston v. Brackett, were to be blotted out, and if we were to return to that case for guidance in the matter at hand, there would not necessarily be a trial by jury. Because all that Chief-Justice Parker says (Marston v. Brackett, 9 N.H. 349 ) is, that he thinks the parties are entitled to a trial by jury upon certain issues, if they are deemed material to the decision. And it may transpire that this issue of whether the dam constitutes a nuisance may not be material to the regulation of the rights. The learned counsel, Judge Smith, says, &#8212; \"They may construe the phrase `heretofore otherwise used and practised' as referring either (1) to the actual practice in New Hampshire, or (2) as referring to the actual practice in the English chancery, which would presumably have furnished the rule for New Hampshire chancery practice, if any had existed. We are ready to meet the plaintiffs on either ground.\" Referring to New Hampshire proceedings, he says, &#8212; \"Now, we propose to take a much broader ground, viz., that there is a constitutional right of jury trial in equity cases generally. . . . Our construction of the exception is, that it refers to the use and practice existing in New Hampshire in 1792, not to the use and practice existing in some other jurisdiction in 1792, nor to the use and practice existing in New Hampshire at some antecedent date. . . . . Equity causes were not tried without a jury in New Hampshire in 1792, for they were not triable at all in this state.\"\n\nIf these reactionary arguments are to prevail, it is certain that the intelligence and business of the age will receive something of a shock. Of course, it is needless for me to say that these propositions are contrary to precedent and authority in this state Indeed, it is conceded that the authority, understanding, and practice for many years have been against the position taken. The grounds of these radical arguments are, that the various courts of the state, passing on these questions, have been guilty of gross legal error, and have been false to history.\n\nThe ingenuity and energy with which he sets out in argument to demonstrate his propositions, demand a compliment to the versatility\nand power of his genius. He easily demolishes the judicial utterances of Judge Bell in Wells v. Pierce,  27 N.H. 512 ; and the commendation of Judge Ladd, in Copp v. Henniker,  55 N.H. 186 , who, in referring to this question, said that Bell was in his day \"the highest authority in all matters of our provincial judicial history,\" does not save him.\n\nThe opinions of Judge Ladd, in Perkins v. Scott and Copp v. Henniker, displayed an historical research and a breadth of judicial reasoning and logic which helped to build for him a reputation as a jurist not limited to the state which he honored while a judge of her highest court, nor to the country to which he belongs, but a reputation reaching beyond, meriting and receiving the judicial plaudits of the great country from which we have been borrowing our jurisprudence. But the structure builded so strongly was easily demolished by his associate. Counsel then passed to the court which rendered the opinion in Bellows v. Bellows, supra, which goes with the rest; and the serio-comic part of the exhibition is presented at this point in the argument, when Judge Ladd mounts the ruins of his own judicial structure, and passes on with the flood at its height, lustily and enthusiastically cheering the author of his ruin.\n\nBut, to be serious, it is a little remarkable, to say the least, that all these respectable authorities should be historically and judicially wrong, and that it should remain for a man in the closing years of the nineteenth century to right them. But I will say right here, that I regard it as utterly immaterial to a decision of the questions necessary to adjust and regulate the water-rights involved in this case, whether the allegation of a nuisance remains in the bill or is withdrawn; whether the attorney-general is a party or not, whether courts of equity existed in New Hampshire immediately preceding the convention of 1792, with general equity powers or with limited equity powers, or whether such court did not exist at all; &#8212; because, under the constitution (Part II, art. 4), the general court was forever clothed with full power to erect and constitute judicatories and courts of record, or other courts; and under art. 20 of the Bill of Rights in question, all controversies between parties are to be tried by jury, except in cases where it had been theretofore otherwise used and practised. The general court, under the constitution, having such power to create courts, and having in 1832, and by later acts, created courts of equity with general powers, the question now presented is, To what usage and practice did the Bill of Rights refer? And we say, as to this, unquestionably the reference is to the usage and practice of the English courts of common law and chancery. And if we establish this position, then the remaining question is, whether it was used and practised in England previous to the adoption of our Bill of Rights to try causes like the one at bar without the intervention of a jury.\n\nA careful reading of art. 4 shows that it was intended to give the legislature the most complete power to create courts, of whatever name or description, necessary to administer ample and full justice to future generations. It provides that such courts so created shall be for hearing, trying, and determining all manner of crimes, offences, pleas, processes, plaints, actions, causes, matters and things whatsoever, arising or happening within this state. Such courts and judicatories so established are granted full power and authority to administer oaths, etc., for the better discovery of truth. Broader scope could not be given.\n\nIt may be observed here, in passing, that courts of law already existed with full common-law powers, and the query is made why this sweeping authority should be given the legislature to create other courts from time to time with jurisdiction over the matters and controversies enumerated in art. 4, Part II of the constitution, if it was intended to limit and restrict their powers to strictly common-law matters and common-law modes of procedure. There will be no question but that art. 20 of the Bill of Rights, which provides that \"in all controversies concerning property, and in all suits between two or more persons, except in cases in which it has been heretofore otherwise used and practised, the parties have a right to trial by jury,\" is broad enough to include controversies about water rights and suits in equity. And while our position will be that the term \"hitherto used and practised\" had reference to the English chancery practice, we shall maintain that there is unmistakable evidence that a court of chancery existed in New Hampshire down to 1792, and that equity proceedings must have been used and practised in this state prior to the convention. Yet we shall also contend, that whether there was little or a great deal of business before that court is of no consequence upon the question of the construction of the exception in art. 20 of the Bill of Rights, as we shall see further on. Now, in the first place, as to this matter, we say that the people, not only in this state but in all the states, have understood that courts of equity have the power to administer equity according to the ordinary course of such procedure, and without the intervention of a jury except at discretion. [Counsel here referred to the act of January 3, 1792, concerning the abatement of certain nuisances, and to s. 6 of the same act.] So it would seem that in 1792, in matters of nuisance, questions of fact were determined by road surveyors and selectmen, and by the superior court justices without the intervention of a jury. At this point I desire to call attention to the ancient statute of 1718, cited by Judge Foster, counsel for the defendant in State v. Saunders, it being claimed by Judge Smith that such statute bears upon the questions involved in this case. He, however, concedes that it would probably be argued that \"notwithstanding the above statute, the provincial court of appeals, composed of the governor and his council, had a theoretical equity jurisdiction in cases of nuisance,\nand was entitled to proceed without a jury.\" In reference to this statute and similar ones, I maintain that it merely gave courts of law concurrent jurisdiction over matters of nuisance. And in view of the fact that English criminal magistrates, courts of law, selectmen, and highway surveyors in this country were exercising control over such matters, the policy was declared that in such proceedings, namely, proceedings at law, and by other tribunals not having equity powers, the fact should be determined by a jury. This could have had no reference to courts of equity, or to any nuisance which from its peculiar situation was cognizable in equity proceedings. As illustrating that this act, which had reference in terms to the court of general sessions of the peace within this province, applied solely to proceedings at law, it may be said that it does not give such courts exclusive jurisdiction, but provides that it shall and may be lawful to and for the court of general sessions of the peace within this province to cause inquiry to be made therein by a jury, meaning, merely, that in all proceedings at law a jury would decide. Such would be the practice in legal proceedings today.\n\nThe judiciary act of 1692 further illustrates that they had in mind at that time the distinction between proceedings at law and proceedings in equity. That act created certain courts of law, but provided \"that no person's right of property shall be by any of the aforesaid courts determined, except where matters of fact are either acknowledged by the parties, or judgment be acknowledged or passeth by the defendant's fault for want of plea or answer, unless the fault be found by a verdict of twelve men of the neighborhood as is ought of right to be by the law.\" This, of course, had reference to proceedings at law. And if a nuisance question was presented in that court it would necessarily be triable by jury.\n\nBut to show that the distinction was marked, even then, by the section following, a court of chancery was created with full powers, in the words following: \"And it is hereby enacted by the authority aforesaid, that there shall be a court of chancery within the province, which said court shall have power to hear and determine all matters of equity, and shall be accounted and esteemed the high court of chancery of this province.\" And the next section provides that the governor and council shall be said high court.\n\nJudge Foster, in his brief in State v. Saunders, seems to have confused the various independent sections, and has placed the guaranty of trial by jury in the act of 1692, as following the provision creating the court of equity, while in fact the guaranty precedes that section, and has reference in terms to the \"aforesaid courts,\" meaning courts of law, while the court of chancery is created as an independent court, with jurisdiction over all matters of equity, and, as we shall see, with remedies according to the English chancery practice.\n\nThat law courts with jury had concurrent jurisdiction with equity courts without a jury in 1718 or 1792 presents no new or novel idea. Such doctrine is true now as regards many subjects and many\nsituations. The plan of the colonists in the beginning, and the plan on which they operated down through, was to build up so far as possible the judicial system approved and practised by their other country. In the commission to John Cutt, first president (Sept. 18, 1679), after describing his duties and that of his council as a \"settled court of record,\" the forms and proceedings of the mother country are recognized. The commission provides, &#8212;\n\n\"So always y[t] y[e] forms of proceeding in such cases, and y[e] judgment thereupon to be given, be as consonant and agreeable to y[e] Laws and Statutes of this Our Realm of Eng[d], as y[e] p[r]ent state and condition of our subjects inhabiting within y[e] limits aforesaid, and y[e] circumstances of y[e] place will admit.\"\n\nCranfield, by his commission, was clothed with authority to \"erect, constitute, and establish such and so many courts of Judicature and public justice within the said province and plantation within your government as you and they shall think fit and necessary for the hearing and determining of all causes, as well criminal as civil, according to law and equity.\" 1 Prov. Pap. 9, 14, 25, 376, 437.\n\nReference has been made to that section of the judiciary act of 1692 (3 Prov. Pap. 183, 186) which provides \"that no person's right of property shall be by any of the aforesaid courts determined, except where matters of fact are either acknowledged by the parties, or judgment be acknowledged or passeth by the defendant's fault for want of plea or answer, unless the fault be found by the verdict of twelve men of the neighborhood, as it ought of right to be by the law.\" It will be observed that this section has been cited by opposing counsel, and commented upon as a provision giving a right of trial by jury as to controverted facts in equity. That such a position is not sound will be seen by a critical examination of all the provisions of this act. It will be seen that this section provides that no person's rights of property shall be by any of the aforesaid courts determined. This reference is, of course, to courts enumerated in that part of the act preceding, which were all courts of law, and were the quarterly courts of sessions, court of common pleas, supreme court of judicature, etc.\n\nThese courts were common-law courts, with jurisdiction to hear, try, and finally determine all actions and causes of actions, and all matters and things triable at the common law, and to settle questions of law arising. The supreme court of judicature was \"fully Impowered and Authorized to have cognizance of all pleas, civall, criminall, and Mixed, as fully  amply to all Intents and purposes whatsoever as the court of King's Bench, Common Pleas, and Excheq[r] within their Magesties' kingdom of England have or ought to have.\" So we argue that this provision requiring the fault to be found by a jury in the quarter sessions had reference to proceedings at law, and none other.\n\nWhat makes my position, that this reference is to proceedings\nat law, absolutely certain, is, that in the same judiciary act, in the very next section (3 Prov. Pap. 186, par. 3). it is provided as follows:\n\n\"And it is hereby Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That there shall be a court of Chancery within this province, which said court shall have power to hear and determine all matters of Equity, and shall be acco[tt]ed and Esteemed the high court of Chancery of this Province: &#8212;\n\nAnd be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid that the Governor and councill be the said high court of Chancery, and hold  keep the said court, and y[t] the Governor may depute, nominate and appoint in his stead a Chancellor, and be assisted with such other persons of the Council as shall by him be thought fitt and Convenient, together with all necessary officers, clerke,  Registers as to the said high court of Chancery are need full.\"\n\nIt will be seen also that by the act of Aug. 7, 1699 (3 Prov. Pap. 221), while it in no way repealed or abridged the powers of the court of chancery enacted by the act of 1692, certain equity powers were given to courts of law to relieve from legal oppression resulting from the verdict of a jury; or, in the words of the act, such courts \"are hereby impowered and authorized to Moderate the rigour of the Law. And on consideration of such cases according to Equity and good Conscience to change such Forfeiture and to enter up Judgment for the just Debt and Damages, And to award Execution accordingly.\"\n\nThe courts so empowered were the justices of the Inferior Court of Common Pleas and the Superior Court of Judicature, and the reference was to forfeiture or penalties under agreements, covenants, etc. This was for convenience, and to save going from one court to the other in this particular class of cases. This cannot be understood, as already stated, as taking away the powers of the court of chancery, because then, as now, as to many matters, it was convenient to have concurrent jurisdiction.\n\nJudge Bell, in Wells v. Pierce,  27 N.H. 512 , in referring to the act of 1692, which act provided for the establishment of a court of chancery within this province, which should have power to hear and determine all matters of equity, and shall be esteemed and accounted the high court of chancery of this province, and that the governor and council be said high court of chancery, says, &#8212; \"It is not known that this law was ever repealed, and it is supposed that the governor and council, who composed the courts of appeals, continued to exercise chancery powers till the Revolution.\" Referring to these acts, Judge Ladd, in Copp v. Henniker, says, &#8212; \"The act of 1699, being published in the editions of 1716 and 1771, was, of course, well known to Judge Bell; and when he says that it is not known that the act of 1692 was ever repealed, his meaning evidently is that it is not known to have been repealed in express terms, or by implication, except to the slight\nextent to which its provisions were incompatible with those subsequently adopted.\" The same judge (Copp v. Henniker,  55 N.H. 179 ,  185 ), referring to the act of 1692, says that the act provides, &#8212; \"3. That there should be a separate court of chancery, in which no provision was made for trial by jury.\" And Mr. Shirley says that the records of the governor and council \"were indifferently termed the records of the court of appeals and of the court of chancery.\" Perkins v. Scott,  57 N.H. 60 .\n\nIn 1727 the provincial house of representatives makes mention of \"the court, sometimes called a court of appeals and sometimes the court of chancery.\" Ib.,  57 N.H. 54 . Judge Smith does not claim that this court was abolished until June 28, 1776.\n\nThis act was not prompted by reason of any arbitrary exercise of power by courts of equity, as will be seen by reference to the preamble of the act of January 5, 1776. It was the appeal from court to court which protracted suits, and the appeal to the court of appeals and to the king of Great Britain, which was complained of as depriving the people of the colony of their great, inestimable, and inherent right of trial by jury. See Preamble, Perkins v. Scott,  57 N.H. 67 .\n\nIn the act of parliament of June 24, 1677, which was later adopted by this province, and published in Province Laws (edition of 1771) 257, we find it provided, concerning wills relating to real estate in that part of Great Britain called England and his majesty's colonies and plantations in America, that the credit of any witness attesting the execution of any will or codicil in such cases shall be considered by the court and the jury, etc., \"or of the court of equity in which the testimony or attestators of any such witness shall be made use of,\" thus recognizing the court of equity at that time, 1771.\n\nBy an act passed about 1718, adopted by order of the governor and council of the province about 1769, published in Province Laws (edition of 1761) 18, 20, 22, the right of appeal was given to all parties from the judge of probate, upon all decrees and orders relative to wills and distribution of estates, to the governor and council for their determination. The governor and council, as has been seen, were the high court of chancery, created by the judiciary act of 1692, which corresponds to our supreme court of probate. This act is cited in Patrick v. Cowles,  45 N.H. 555 , in which case the court holds, Judge Sargent delivering the opinion, I think, that the right of trial by jury does not exist in such causes. And Brooks v. Heath holds that the right of review does not exist in equity proceedings. In this case the opinion of the court was by Judge Ladd. It is conceded by counsel that the high court of chancery, created by the act of 1692, was in existence until June 28, 1776, in theory if not in practice, at which time it is claimed that such court was abolished. Grant, for the purposes of argument, that this be true, still the reasoning of Judges Gilchrist\nand Parker, in State v. Rollins in 8 N.H., as to art. 90, Part II of the constitution, is broad enough to clothe our courts of equity, under the act of 1832, with full English chancery powers.\n\nNow, suppose that this high court of chancery was abolished June 28, 1776 &#8212; and I do not concede this, in view of the holding in State v. Rollins, as to what acts and laws remained in force under art. 90 of the constitution, and in view of the further fact that the preamble goes for \"the courts of appeals in this colony,\" and not courts of equity; &#8212; but suppose it was repealed in the era of revolution, and assume that the exercise of power in this court was not among the grievances complained of, and after sixteen years covering the war and a few years following, which was a period of turmoil, excitement, and uncertainty: is it reasonable to assume that the framers, when providing for a jurisprudence, and referring historically to a practice and usage theretofore existing, intended the crude and uncertain period of war judiciary, rather than the great system of jurisprudence of the centuries preceding? It seems to me that the people of this state have a right to rely upon the judicial utterances of the last half century. Judge Bell, in Wells v. Pierce, speaking of courts of equity, says, &#8212; \"The limits of their jurisdiction in these cases are coextensive with those of the court of chancery and other courts of equity in England. Equity, as a great branch of the laws of their native country, was brought over by the colonists, and has always existed as a part of the common law in its broadest sense in New Hampshire.\" This question seems to have been fully considered by Judge Bell in that case.\n\nBut great stress is placed upon the message sent to the legislature by Governor Bell in 1821. While this is an official message, it is simply the opinion or assertion of one man, a political and executive officer, and, of course, not conclusive. While such utterances are entitled to a fair measure of credit, they are not conclusive by any means. The opinions of lawyers and executives differ as to jurisdiction of courts, as to remedies and procedures. Disputes arise as to what is within and what is without the jurisdiction of courts. Ask a practitioner today as to whether a given case is one to be adjusted in equity or settled at law: he may answer clearly, In equity; &#8212; another of equal prominence may say, Not in equity at all, for such questions can only be settled at law.\n\nSuppose, for illustration, that the Connecticut River Lumber Company had never come into existence, and that the Olcott Falls Company had never had an existence, and that the discussions involved in the present case had never been precipitated, and that Judge Ladd were to be called upon forty years hence to express an opinion, official or otherwise, upon the question of equity jurisdiction and procedure at the time of the adoption of the constitution: he would, with confidence, give utterance to the assertions and opinions in Perkins v. Scott and Copp v. Henniker. And now the situation\nis changed. Thirty years hence, if Judge Smith were required to give utterance, his opinion, presumably, would be otherwise. Hence we argue that personal and official executive utterances should be received with caution. Reference is also made to the opinion of Judge Parker, in Marston v. Brackett,  9 N.H. 336 . But, so far as it appears, no historical investigation was made in that case; the court did not consider the question as to what system of use and practice the exception in art. 20 referred whether English or Provincial. The only authority referred to in the opinion is Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge, 7 Pick. 369.\n\nJudge Ladd, in speaking of Chief-Justice Parker and his opinion in Marston v. Brackett,  9 N.H. 336 , decided in 1838, says, \"that until this case it had not been intimated in this state, or anywhere else, that there was a right of trial by jury in equity proceedings. I venture to say, that if such a right ever existed in this state, it was after, and not before, the observation of Chief-Justice Parker in that case. It is not necessary, in the view I take, to inquire whether that observation established such a singular and anomalous doctrine in this state or not. It is enough that up to that time all the books and cases, wherever the common law prevails, are the other way.\" Perkins v. Scott,  57 N.H. 81 .\n\nIn Copp v. Henniker,  55 N.H. 210 ,  211 , Judge Ladd uses the following strong language: \"The researches of Judge Bell brought to light material facts that were unknown to his father when he said, in his message to the legislature of 1821, that `Our ancestors, who adopted in general the laws of that country from which they originated as the basis of their code, omitted to introduce into practice that part of the system which appertains to chancery jurisdiction.' If Judge Parker had understood this branch of our provincial history as Chief-Justice Bell understood it, it would seem that it would not have been held (as it was, without consideration, in 1838) that the constitution guarantees the right of jury trial in cases within the jurisdiction of chancery.\" In speaking of the act of 1692, he adds, &#8212; \"Judge Bell, the highest authority on all matters of our provincial judicial history, says that it is not known that this law was ever repealed, and that it is supposed the court of chancery continued to exercise its powers till the Revolution.\" Ib.,  55 N.H. 186 .\n\nIn speaking of this question, in Perkins v. Scott,  57 N.H. 81 , and of the bearing of the actual practice upon the question of the right of trial by jury, Judge Ladd says, &#8212; \"It adds very little to the argument, one way or the other, so far as I can see, whether, any provincial court ever, in fact, exercised chancery powers, making use of the forms of proceedings usually employed for that purpose in England, and latterly in this country\" &#8212; thus agreeing, in this respect, with Judge Parker, in State v. Rollins, 8 N.H. 563 , who, in speaking of art. 90 of the constitution, says that actual use is not the test.\n\nSupposing that the power to enforce specific performance had been exercised by any tribunal either in the province or the state, or supposing that it had not, Judge Ladd says, &#8212; \"If it was a power never used nor practised in the province before the constitution in any form, then, to determine the true application of the terms `heretofore used and practised' as used in the Bill of Rights we must go to the common law with respect to the new right and power thus conferred; and, doing that, we find it not to be a case in which it had been used and practised anywhere before the constitution, to have a trial by jury as matter of legal right.\" Perkins v. Scott,  57 N.H. 81 ,  82 . So we see that we are greatly indebted to the judicial learning, the historical research, the strong and forcible reasoning, and the logical deductions of Judge Ladd for the condition in which we find this question.\n\nIn 1876 this question was again considered, and the court, as then constituted (and it is supposed, after consideration), held, in Bellows v. Bellows, supra, that the constitutional right of trial by jury in chancery cases does not exist as a constitutional right in New Hampshire. This question as again discussed by the present chief-justice in Wooster v. Plymouth,  62 N.H. 203 , where it is said, &#8212; \"The exception of `cases in which it has been heretofore otherwise used and practised' (art. 20) is neither a reservation nor a grant of jury trial in any case, but an exception of cases in which the right is not reserved. The essentials of that method of adjudication are shown by common-law principles and by history.\" See cases cited.\n\nIn Davis v. Dyer,  62 N.H. 236 , it is said by Judge Allen, &#8212; \"It must be considered as settled in this state that cases within the equity jurisdiction of the court were, previous to and at the time of the adoption of the constitution, a class which it had not been the practice to try by jury, and to which the right guaranteed by the Bill of Rights was not extended and did not apply. There is not and never has been any absolute constitutional right of trial by jury for equity causes. . . . The other cases before cited, all decided [citing Perkins v. Scott with approval] that there was no absolute constitutional right of jury trial in causes within the equity jurisdiction of the court.\" It seems to us that this question should be considered as settled, and that parties should understand that their rights will be regulated in accordance with the doctrine so often promulgated.\n\nRegarding the question whether there were courts of equity with full chancery powers in this state in 1792 as entirely immaterial, we shall endeavor to establish two propositions: 1. That in construing the exception \"heretofore used and practised,\" reference should be had to the previous practice in England. 2. That the right of trial by jury in equity causes like the one in question, involving the regulation of water-rights where both parties had a conceded right and title, did not exist as a matter of right in England,\nand that it was not used and practised to try such causes by jury. Undoubtedly the term \"hitherto used and practised\" had reference to the uses and practices of the past, in this country and in England, but more essentially to established rules of practice in England. If there was no use or practice here, and the framers had intended to save the light of jury trial in all controversies, why not say so? They could have expressed themselves very decidedly, and in a few words, as, for instance, \"The right of trial by jury in all controversies between parties concerning property shall be forever inviolate.\"\n\nDoes any one claim that this exception had reference to controversies as to wills and accounts only? If such had been the intent, it could have been expressed in unmistakable terms. \"All controversies except as to wills and accounts\" would have clearly stated the intention. The fact that special classes of cases are not expressed, shows that the exception was intended to be of broader scope. But the fact that they qualified this guaranty and made a general exception of those cases where it had been theretofore used and practised otherwise, shows unmistakably that they did not intend what counsel claim, but, on the contrary, wisely provided that the legislature might create courts ample to administer justice for all time and under all circumstances; and the only limitation or restraint which they placed upon that branch of the government was to say. Cases which have hitherto been tried by jury, shall be tried by jury in the future. It was the English jurisprudence which was referred to. It was not the steady and ordinary course of the English common-law and equity jurisprudence that estranged our forefathers and precipitated the Revolution, but executive usurpations and parliamentary encroachments. It was not among their purposes to establish a new jurisprudence, but it was designed to adopt and perfect that of the mother country.\n\nThe language of this exception, \"heretofore otherwise used and practised,\" should be received in its ordinary sense, because there is no historic reason for putting upon it an unusual meaning. It is manifest that it was intended to preserve the right of jury trial except as to those classes of rights and controversies which had been theretofore otherwise adjusted. As has been already said, it will not be contended that the general provision is not broad enough to include equity causes. But we say that the exception was intended to except equity causes from the operation of the general provision. And, instead of undertaking to enumerate in the constitution the particular cases in which courts of equity should have jurisdiction, it left that to be judicially determined by the courts of the future according to the practice and usage which had theretofore obtained, in the jurisprudence after which we were forming our system, and the term \"heretofore\" Call only be viewed as having reference to the English system of common law\nand equity. Legal rights cannot be ascertained or measured by narrow, particular periods of time. In the ascertainment of right, courts are continually adhering to precedents, ancient and modern.\n\nIs it contended that rights, remedies, and proceedings should he ascertained and measured by the usage practised on the day of the adoption of the constitution? This would be absurd. Well, then, if that particular day was not the guide, what period will you take? Will you take one year, or two years, or ten years, or the quarter of the century preceding? This would be equally absurd. The term \"heretofore\" had reference to the past &#8212; to the past history of common-law and equitable rights and proceedings &#8212; to the whole history.\n\nHere is a position from which, it seems to me, there is no escape. If the historical argument of opposing counsel is true that, technically, no court of equity existed in the province at the time of the adoption of the constitution (which I do not concede), and his further argument is sound, that the exception in the 20th article of the Bill of Rights must be construed as having reference to that particular period (which I do not concede), then it follows, as a matter of course, that the right of trial by jury exists in all equity proceedings, upon all issues, although for hundreds of years previous it had been used and practised differently in England. It seems to me that the broader and more reasonable view is, that these people understood that they were building from the common-law and equity jurisprudence of England. They did not assume to define all the powers of the courts, or to create all the courts that future generations should need to settle their disputes, though they did provide that the general court should forever have full power and authority to \"erect and constitute judicatories and courts of record, or other courts, for hearing and trying all processes, causes, matters, and things whatsoever,\" etc. Constitution, Part II, art. 4.\n\nAs is well known, art. 90, Part II of our present constitution, down to the proviso, was in the constitution of 1783, and this was based upon somewhat similar phraseology in the act of April, 1777, entitled \"An act `for the reestablishing of the general system of laws heretofore in force in this state.'\" It will be observed that this article has reference to practice in the courts of law. It will be observed, also, that the language is more explicit in the direction of restriction than the exception in art. 20 of the Bill of Rights. Mark the difference. In the Bill of Rights the language is \"except in cases in which it has been heretofore otherwise used and practised;\" &#8212; no reference to the practice in the province, or to this country; &#8212; while art. 90 provides that \"all the laws which have heretofore been adopted, used, and approved in the province, colony, or state of New Hampshire, and usually practised on in the courts of law, shall remain and be in full force until altered and repealed\nby the legislature, such parts thereof only excepted as are repugnant to the lights and liberties contained in this constitution.\"\n\nI will not comment at length upon the very able and comprehensive opinion of Judge Parker, in State v. Rollins, where it was held that an indictment for the English common-law offence of false imprisonment and kidnapping was sustainable in this state, although there was no statute or express law here creating such an offence, but will quote one paragraph of the opinion which has reference to art. 90 in question: and it will be seen that this indictment was sustained on the ground that the English law, existing before the Revolution, was continued in force by virtue of art. 90. The court says, &#8212; \"It is perfectly apparent that the body of the common law, as previously in force, was comprehended in this enactment. That was a part, and a very important part, of the general system of laws which were to be reestablished by the act. If it was not as a body comprehended in the act, it must either have become entirely nugatory, &#8212; which cannot be supposed, for without some parts of it the administration of justice could not have been continued, &#8212; or it must have remained in force by some inherent vigor of its own; for there is nothing to indicate that a separation was then to be made in it, and such parts only of it as could be shown to have been actually used in the courts of justice to be adopted, and the residue, which was in force before, although not shown to have been used, to be rejected. If any part of it was within the act, the whole body of it previously in force was so, except such parts as were incompatible with the new form of government.\" State v. Rollins,  8 N.H. 562 ,  563 .\n\nIn Pierce v. State,  13 N.H. 536 , it was contended that questions should not be put to the jury as to whether they had formed opinions as to the law in the case, because, as it was claimed, the juror or jurors were judges of the law in the period before 1792, and that therefore they were entitled, under the constitution, to that kind of jury trial. This is the case, as will be remembered, where John P. Hale said the friends of free government and popular rights are on one side, and those of legitimacy, aristocracy, etc., on the other. It will be in vain for the court to throw themselves before the car which carries on the progress of free principles. The questions involved were deemed of sufficient importance and gravity to call for the opinion of two members of the court, namely, Gilchrist and Parker.\n\nJudge Gilchrist says, &#8212; \"At the time of the adoption of the constitution, the common law was the law of the state, so far as it was applicable to our institutions and the circumstances of the country.\" Ib.,  13 N.H. 542 . In speaking of the kind of jury intended by the constitution, he says, &#8212; \"As a common-law question, this must be determined by the authorities. Wherever they lead us, it is our duty to follow. Whatever result they may establish, it is our duty to declare.\" Ib.,  13 N.H. 543 . And the learned judge\nproceeds to an examination of the English authorities, for the purpose of ascertaining the kind of jury system used in the law courts of England.\n\nJudge Parker, in discussing this same question, says, &#8212; \"So far as I am aware, it is not known at the present day [1843] what was the doctrine of the courts here upon this point before the Revolution. It is well understood, however, that the administration of justice [before the Revolution] was in general of a very inartificial character. . . . it is very clear that we cannot resort with much safety to the rulings or decisions of that time for the purpose of determining a contested question involving legal principles. Even after the Revolution and the adoption of the constitution, although perhaps substantial justice was administered in most cases, little can be claimed for the courts on the score of their scientific administration of the law, according to strict legal rules. . . . If, therefore, we do not look with the utmost confidence to the period immediately succeeding the Revolution for precedents, it is not a matter of reproach to the men who were then engaged in laying broadly and deeply the foundations of a government.\" Ib.,  13 N.H. 557 .\n\nJudge Parker practically admits that the jury had to some extent been judges of the law in both civil and criminal cases, but says, &#8212; \"It is obvious, from this brief review of some portion of our early jurisprudence, that it cannot furnish a rule for the action of the courts at the present day.\" Ib.,  13 N.H. 558 ,  560 .\n\nLater, in 1869, this doctrine was forcibly reiterated and emphasized in State v. Hodge. The opinion in that case was by the present chief-justice, who speaks of the doctrine of Judge Parker, in Pierce v. State, as a novelty at the time, but expresses the wonder that there could ever have been any doubt of its soundness; and says that the system (jury system) inaugurated by Judge Parker in 1842, contrary to the practice previous to 1792, was and is to be accepted as a fundamental theory of the constitution, an ancient principle of the common law, and the true construction of the Great Charter. The court say, &#8212; \"History discarded the old practice as a test of the right and duty of the jury to decide the law. We are not at liberty to adhere to it [the old practice] as a test of the right and duty of the court to decide the fact. If the application of this doctrine in its whole length and breadth should clear the law of a great mass of facts which encumber it, the result would be not only an ideal vindication of constitutional principle, but also a practical improvement, tending to facilitate the study and administration of the law, and to make it a more intelligible and rational system of general rules &#8212; a point of no small consequence in a society which undertakes to found its institutions upon popular intelligence.\" State v. Hodge,  50 N.H. 510 ,  523 ,  524 .\n\nIt may be proper to observe, in passing, that the court at that time embraced other eminent constitutional judges, such as the late Chief-Justice Bellows, the Hon. Jeremiah Smith and the Hon.\nWilliam Spencer Ladd, now of counsel for the defendants in the case at bar, who concurred in the opinion. Now, what is the import of that opinion in Pierce v. State, which both the counsel for the defendants, as members of the court in 1869, fully indorsed? Simply this, and nothing less, &#8212; that the constitutional guaranty of jury trials (although there is no reference to the past) reaches beyond the actual jury as practised and used in the province and state prior to 1792, and embraces the jury known and used in the English common-law system.\n\nJudge Foster, in King v. Hopkins,  57 N.H. 346 ,  348 ,  350 , after speaking of the imperfect jury practice prior to 1792, makes the following forcible statement: \"So the constitutional conventions of 1783 and 1792 must have had the same intent as those judges &#8212; Dudley, Farrar, and others. They must have intended such a jury trial as that of the common law of England, under which they had always lived, and which they adopted, &#8212; not precisely that trial in every unimportant detail, but precisely that in substance and so far as its essentials were concerned.\"\n\nJudge Smith and others, in the convention of 1792, did not understand the \"sacred right\" and \"inestimable privilege\" of trial by jury to mean such a trial as overturned all law before such judges as \"never read, and never would read\" the \"sages of the law.\" The \"sacred right\" and \"inestimable privilege,\" not conferred, but confirmed, by the Bill of Rights, was, in the mind and intention of those who declared it, the common-law jury trial, in all its essential and time-honored attributes. And it is not possible that any other kind of jury trial can be sustained as the true legal construction of the constitution.\n\nThe authorities are numerous that construe common-law terms in a constitution according to their common-law signification. Our constitution is to be construed by the light of the common law. A system of jury trial, such as our English ancestors never knew, might have been created by our constitution-makers; but if they had chosen such a creation, they would have conferred upon their creature some distinctive and recognizable mark. Instead of this, they used a familiar term to express their idea; &#8212; but if any one will seek for a definition of the term, he must draw from that great fountain, the common law; and in doing this, he must bear in mind, as I said a little while ago, that this right of jury trial is not conferred, but confirmed, by the constitution; that it is not the beginning of a law for the state, but that it assumes the existence of a well understood system, which is to be continued in force and \"held sacred.\" Cool. Con. Lim. 60. If any common-law term has a settled and definite signification, it is \"trial by jury.\"\n\nThe argument seems ridiculously narrow, that when the framers gave the legislature full and complete power (under art. 4, Part II) to erect all kinds of courts, so that all processes and remedies should be open to the people as their interests and demands might\nin the future require, and that all kinds of causes and complaints might be heard and justice speedily administered; that after doing all this for future generations, they should make a sudden turn, and strictly limit the power and practice of the courts so erected to the condition of courts already in existence, and to the period just preceding and following the Revolution; that no other processes or methods should be used; that the term \"hitherto used and practised\" was to be cut short; and that the courts for all times should draw their methods and powers from that limited judicial fountain, &#8212; this, I say, seems to me simply ridiculous. This would be giving power to the legislatures for the mere purpose of at once destroying its practical utility and operations. I contend that art. 4, Part II of the constitution, shows that the framers of the constitution realized that they had not erected a complete judiciary; that they intended to leave that to future legislatures, as necessities might arise; while they also intended to protect the jury trial, as it had grown and formed into a system in England. No other argument can stand the test of reason and thought for a moment.\n\nDrawing from the whole country for precedent for his argument, the only dictum counsel finds in support of it is that of Judge Ladd, in Copp v. Henniker,  55 N.H. 191 ,  192 . But this dictum had reference to an actual practice in the province. Now, suppose there was no \"practice\" to do a certain thing in a certain proceeding in this province: then where does the \"heretofore\" carry you? Nowhere? Or is it reasonable to suppose they meant some system somewhere? If there was a system of equity jurisprudence in England, time-honored and well understood, in which it had been \"used and practised\" to regulate certain classes of controversies and certain classes of rights without a jury, and if it be true, as argued by the other side, that such proceedings had not been \"used and practised\" here at all prior to 1792, is it any less probable that the exception \"heretofore otherwise used and practised\" had reference to such well understood practice and usage in English courts of chancery, than that the guaranty of trial by jury, without any allusion whatever to practice or usage theretofore had reference to the well known and time-honored jury system of England described by Judge Parker in Pierce v. State, 13 N.H., and by Judge Foster in King v. Hopkins, 57 N.H., rather than the crude and inartificial jury system which was in actual use and practice in the colonial, provincial, and early state periods of our history, as held in these cases? To argue that it is less probable, is to argue the term \"heretofore otherwise used and practised\" meaningless verbiage, referring to practice nowhere, and that the authors of it were a set of narrow, senseless old gentlemen &#8212; an argument which ought not to prevail against the acknowledged historic wisdom and rugged common-sense of the men who constituted that illustrious body. In other words, if the guaranty part\nof the clause as to jury trial means a jury trial of the law courts of England, according to the common-law practice, why does not the exception, which is the other part of the same clause, by force of the same reasoning, mean the equity trials of England according to the chancery practice of that country? Or, again: If the system of equity was practised here prior to 1792, inartificially or imperfectly, as the jury system was practised, or if it was practised to a limited extent, is it less probable that the exception refers to the more perfect system of England than that the guaranty, without any backward reference whatever, means the more perfect jury system of England as administered under the rules of the common law rather than the inartificial actual jury practice of the stormy period of the Revolution, as it is sometimes expressed in books? Or, still again: If full chancery powers existed in New Hampshire at the time of the adoption of the constitution, we still maintain that the exception referred to the practice here and in England.\n\nIt is said by the court, in King v. Hopkins,  57 N.H. 348 , &#8212; \"It may be that the New Hampshire practice before 1792 as a historical fact, and the jury trial of the common law as a principle, should both be considered in the effort to ascertain what kind of a trial the framers of the constitution meant and intended in 1792 by jury trial.\" And if this reasoning be true as to law courts, why not as to courts of equity? Still again: If there was no practice here at all, as claimed by the other side, then the reference must have been to English practice alone, &#8212; and the legislature having the power under the constitution to create such courts, when created such courts would take the modes and usages of the system to which the exception referred. As bearing upon the probable intention, if it be true, as claimed by counsel, that there had been no exercise of chancery practice in New Hampshire for a half century prior to 1792, it is reasonably certain that the denial of jury trial in such proceedings was not a grievance against which our forefathers were revolting; nor could it have been the grievance stated against the British Crown in the Declaration of Independence, \"for depriving us in many cases of the benefits of trial by jury.\" If his argument is true, the grievance referred to in the Declaration must have been the denial of jury trial in causes other than equity. There is nothing in history, there is nothing in our jurisprudence, there is no peculiar principle in our institutions, which make equity proceedings, according to the ordinary course in England, repugnant to the people of this country.\n\nOne other position taken by counsel in his argument, where he undertakes to lay upon a party the burden of showing as fact that cases in equity were triable without a jury in New Hampshire prior to the adoption of the constitution, needs to be noticed. Of course, if our argument be sound, that the reference was to English jurisprudence, this question is of no practical importance; but if it\nbe otherwise, we should say it is not a question of burden of proof, but one to be settled upon judicial and historical examination. The argument that the right, being reserved to the legislature by art. 20, to change the mode of trial in cases arising on the high seas and such as relate to mariners' wages, shows that the exception as to cases otherwise used and practised had reference to practice in New Hampshire, is erroneous. It shows the reverse. At least, it does not show what is claimed for it. It is asserted that it was the actual practice in New Hampshire to try such cases by jury. That being so, the general clause preserving such right might put it beyond the power of the legislature to provide other methods. It might have become a vested right. This proviso means, that the legislature should have the right in this class of cases, triable at law, to withdraw the right of trial by jury, and has no reference whatever to the class of rights embraced by the exception. No danger comes from the suggestion as to the power of the attorney-general, as an officer of the public, to make the proceeding civil or criminal. The attorney-general does not, by instituting the proceeding, determine any question of right. If he thinks the remedy at law by indictment adequate, he may institute such a proceeding. Or, if he deems the remedy at law inadequate, he may set forth his allegations in equity by information, as has been done for hundreds of years. But this does not determine the rights of anybody. It becomes a question of jurisdiction, and it is for the court to say, from the nature of the case, whether it is a case where the legal remedies are adequate, or whether, upon approved and well understood principles, it is a cause cognizable in equity. There is nothing new, startling, or novel about this.\n\nNow, as bearing upon this question of whether the framers were referring to the practice in England, we may well inquire as to the constructions which have been put upon similar safeguards by the various courts of this country. We shall get light there. Take, for instance, the jury safeguard, where the constitutions make no reference to the past practice or to any system, merely providing that the right of trial by jury shall be held inviolate. The courts have invariably held this to mean the common-law jury of England. For instance, note again on this point the language of Judge Ladd, in Copp v. Henniker,  55 N.H. 193 , where, in quoting from East Kingston v. Towle,  48 N.H. 64 , he says, &#8212; \"The trial by jury secured to the subject by the constitution is a trial according to the course of the common law.\" See, also, Opinion of the Justices,  41 N.H. 550 ; 2 Sto. Const., s. 1779, n. 2; Sedg. Stat. Law 493, n. 2d ed.; Cool. Con Lim. 319; State v. Peterson,  41 Vt. 522 ; see  27 Vt. 359 . Judge Bell says (in 27 N.H. 512 ) \"the question whether this court [a court of equity] will lose their jurisdiction because there is an adequate remedy at law, is to be decided here as it would be in England.\" Thus showing that upon this subject of adequacy at law, reference should be made to the practice of England.\n\n[Counsel commented on Robinson v. Campbell, 3 Wheat. 212-221, United States v. Howland, 4 Wheat. 108, 115, and Herbert v. Wren, 7 Cranch 370-376.]\n\nPratt v. Pond, 5 Allen 59, is not against the reasoning of the foregoing cases, although it might at first so seem. The only suggestion of consequence there is, that when the jurisdiction depends upon inadequacy of remedy at law, the question of adequacy is to be determined under the statutes of Massachusetts and their course of practice. This term, of course, is quite different from one referring to a practice and usage hitherto obtaining, as our Bill of Rights in substance does. [Counsel quoted from Prof. Jur., ss. 84, 87.]\n\nIn three states &#8212; Ohio, Kansas, and Vermont &#8212; the guaranty is most strongly expressed in the following language: \"The right of trial by jury shall be inviolate.\" Even in these states the same interpretation prevails, and I propose to refer to the decisions of these states first.\n\nIn Kansas, in 1866, the court, speaking through its chief-justice, said, in Kimball v. Connor,  3 Kan. 432 , &#8212; \"The plaintiffs in error insist that the act relating to proceedings in the county of Douglass, approved February 9, 1864, is unconstitutional and void because it does not authorize the trial by jury. This presents the question whether this is a case within the meaning of the constitutional provision &#8212; Bill of Rights, s. 5 &#8212; `The right of trial by jury shall be inviolate.' It is unnecessary to determine whether the investigation provided for in the act referred to is strictly a `trial.' Admitting for the purposes of this case that it is a trial, it will not follow that the act is in contravention of the constitutional provision. That provision does not require every trial to be by jury. Nor does it contemplate that every issue which by the laws in force at the adoption of the constitution of the state was triable by jury, should remain irrevocably triable by that tribunal. Trial by jury is guaranteed only in those cases where that light existed at common law. Such is the meaning of the constitutional provision referred to; and in statutory proceedings, proceedings in chancery, etc., the legislature is fully competent to dispense with the jury.\"\n\nThis provision of the Vermont constitution was under consideration in Plimpton v. Somerset,  33 Vt. 291 , where it was said, &#8212; \"In all these, and other similar cases which might be noted, the immemorial practice of proceeding to trial without a jury, in the common-law courts of England and of this country, has been held conclusive to show that they are not, within the terms of the constitution, `proper for the cognizance of a jury,' and were not intended to be therein included.\" In the course of the same opinion it is said, &#8212; \"The constitution was intended to provide for the future as well as the past, to protect the rights of the people, . . . whether those rights then existed by the rules of the common law, or might from time to time arise out of subsequent legislation. All the rights, whether then or thereafter arising, which would properly\nfall into those classes of rights to which by the course of the common law the trial by jury was secured, were intended to be embraced within this article. . . . It is the nature of the controversy between the parties, and its fitness to be tried by jury according to the rules of the common law, that must decide the question.\"\n\nThe case of lessee of Cochran's Heirs v. Loring,  17 Ohio 409 , is in more respects than one a noticeable and valuable case, as well in respect to its historical references as to the strong language used by Judge Hitchcock in disposing of the question. [Counsel quoted from the case at length, and commented on it.]\n\nOur purpose in citing these reasonings is to show that, among the states, guaranties similar to our Bill of Rights are understood to have reference to the long established English system.\n\nKlonne v. Bradstreet, 2 Handy 78, was a bill in equity to foreclose a mortgage. There it was distinctly held that the parties are not entitled as a matter of right to a trial by jury, but the granting or the withholding it is in the discretion of the court.\n\nIn Carlisle v. Foster,  10 Ohio St. 198 . was a bill in chancery for the enforcement of a trust and for an account by the trustee: \"It was, therefore [says Chief-Justice Brinkerhoff], a matter of discretion in the court below whether it would submit any question of fact, and if so, what questions involved in the case were to be tried by jury.\"\n\nEllithorpe v. Buck,  17 Ohio St. 72 , was an action under the code which abolished the distinction between actions at law and suits in chancery, and under which the civil action was substituted for both. An action was brought by a party claiming legal title and possession of real property, to determine the interest of a party claiming an estate there adverse to him, and to enjoin such party from committing irreparable injury to the property by cutting timber thereon. Held, there being no issue of fact arising in the pleading \"for the recovery of money, or of specific real or personal property,\" neither party has a right, under the 263d section of the code, to demand a trial by jury; but the issues are properly triable to the court, although the location of the boundary line between the adjoining lands of the respective parties is the matter in dispute.\n\nIn New Jersey, under a constitutional provision \"that the inestimable right of trial by jury shall remain confirmed as a part of the law of this state without repeal forever,\" where the question was taken that the right of trial by jury was secured in all cases, the court, as early as 1793, through Kinsey, C. J., in Wood v. Tallman, N. J. Law 153, held that the constitution does not extend the right to a trial by jury to cases which did not fall within its province before the existence of that charter; the chancery prerogative and the spiritual courts have always proceeded without the intervention of a jury; and the orphans' courts, being\ninvested with those powers, as defined and limited by the act of assembly, may exercise them as before without any violation of the right of trial by jury. See, also, Scudder v. Company, N. J. Eq. 696; McGear v. Woodruff; 4 Vroom 216; Howe v. Plainfield, 8 Vroom 145; State v. Doty, 3 Vroom 403, 405; In re Lower Chatham, 6 Vroom 497.\n\nIn Howe v. Plainfield, 8 Vroom. 148, the court say, quoting approvingly from Mr. Justice Strong in a Pennsylvania case, \"its measure [right of trial by jury] is therefore to be sought in the usage which prevailed at the time when it was asserted. But never in England was there any usage, and, consequently, was there any right, in the subject that every litigated question of fact should be submitted to a jury. In all that large class of cases which are cognizable in courts of equity, there never was any right of trial by jury, nor did the right extend to many other civil and criminal proceedings.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, the Bill of Rights declares that \"trial by jury shall be as heretofore, and the right thereof remain inviolate;\" in effect, precisely the same as art. 20 of the New Hampshire Bill of Rights.\n\nThe opinion of Mr. Justice Strong, in Byers v. Commonwealth, 42 Pa. St. 89, 94, is worthy of special note. The head note states the substance of the decision, and is in the following language: \"The constitutional provision relative to trial by jury was intended to preserve the right as it existed at the formation of our state government, and not to increase or extend it, and must be construed with reference to the statutes that were in force in England and in the province of Pennsylvania, at the adoption of the first constitution of the state.\"\n\nBut I desire to call the attention of the court to the reasoning of this case. Judge Strong says, &#8212; \"The objection is based upon a misconception. We inquire not now after the mode in which such a trial was conducted. Our business at present is to ascertain how far the right to a trial by jury extended, &#8212; to what controversies it was applicable. All looked to preservation, not extension. It is the old right, whatever it was, that was to be preserved. None of the powers of government or constitutions under which we have lived have contemplated any extension of the right by and the limits in which it had been enjoyed previous to the settlement of the state or the adoption of the constitution. But never in England . . . in all that large class of cases which are cognizable in equity, was there right of trial by jury.\" Mere quotations will not do justice to the strength of the opinion in this case.\n\nIn New York, the provision in the constitution of 1777 is, that \"the trial by jury in all cases in which it has been heretofore used shall remain inviolate forever.\" This was held in the court of appeals as intending the common-law jury. Wynehamer v. The People,  13 N.Y. 378 . It does not include equity cases.\n\nIt was said, in Rathbun v. Rathbun, 3 How. Pr. 141, \"A trial by a justice of the supreme court at a special term of an equity case is clearly within the implied exception of the constitution,\" citing approvingly Lee v. Tillotson, 24 Wend. 337.\n\nIn Empire City Bank,  18 N.Y. 210 , it is said that a trial by jury is preserved by the constitution; but in controversies cognizable in courts of equity a jury trial was never in general resorted to.\n\nI shall not follow the investigation of the equity practice in the various states further at this time, except to refer to Judge Ladd's criticism of Marston v. Brackett in Copp v. Henniker,  55 N.H. 211 , where he says that this doctrine seems to be acknowledged nowhere but in New Hampshire; and to the remark of Mr. Pomeroy, in his notes to Sedg. St. Law 489, 2d ed., that the New Hampshire doctrine is purely exceptional, and must depend upon an early practice in that state peculiar to itself. See, also, Pom. Eq., ss. 299, 308. There was no peculiar or exceptional practice in New Hampshire justifying the opinion in Marston v. Brackett, and it can only be accounted for upon the ground suggested by Judge Ladd in Copp v. Henniker,  55 N.H. 211 , that it was without consideration.\n\nI now come to the second point, which is the English chancery jurisdiction and practice. And in the first place I desire to call attention to Judge Smith's treatment of the questions involved in this case. In his discussion of the English practice, he treats the question as distinctly one of nuisance, common to the whole public, and as though the right and title were neither conceded nor established, in utter disregard of the fact that the bill presents other questions as to the regulation of water-rights, in which the parties have an unquestioned and conceded right of use, and in which the plaintiff has a special interest beyond that of the general public. The nuisance question may or may not become a question in this case. At all events it is not the sole and only question. I shall refer to this further on, but desire that the distinction should be borne in mind.\n\nCourts of equity have exercised jurisdiction over water-rights, rights of purpresture, and nuisance and waste in connection with such rights, and over nuisance as an independent cause, from the earliest periods.\n\nFor the purposes of my position in the case at bar, it is not necessary for me to maintain, and I do not, that the class of statutory nuisances covered by the so called \"nuisance act\" in New Hampshire may be tried without the intervention of a jury. Nor do I oppose the idea. I do, however, maintain that the grounds do not run on the same lines; that there is and ever has been a distinction between nuisances created by statute, as well as common-law nuisances, such as in creating and maintaining conditions prejudicial to health, with a money penalty or imprisonment\nattached, and quasi nuisances, such as are involved in water-rights or rights of purpresture.\n\nOne class of nuisances embodies the element of crime either per se or prohibitum, with penal punishment in the line of the criminal administration of justice, while the other may be a nuisance, or may be a mere infringement of a right common to the public, and against which courts of equity furnish redress to a person sustaining special injury. It can be said, however, that there were in England certain classes of nuisances and misdemeanors which were restrained without trial by jury. The ground, I believe, was, that when the thing complained of was a nuisance per se, the court would say that a man should not devote his property to such uses. While I do not argue against jurisdiction in the liquor nuisance cases, or for the jury trial in such proceedings, I do say that the two cases should not be confounded. They are on different lines.\n\nBut to resume as to the case in hand: A distinction has been made from the earliest times between a plaintiff who has no special interest beyond that of a member of the public to abate the nuisance, and a plaintiff who is suffering special injury by reason thereof. Lord Eldon said, in 1812, in King v. Dewsnap, 16 East 196 (a proceeding by indictment), &#8212; \"I did not expect that it would be disputed at this day that though a nuisance may be public, yet that there may be a special grievance arising out of the common cause of injury which presses more upon particular individuals than others not so immediately within the influence of it.\"\n\nIn regard to nuisances, the jurisdiction of courts of equity, says Story (s. 921), \"seems to be of a very ancient date, and has been distinctly traced back to the time of Queen Elizabeth,\" citing Ed. Inj., c. 11, p. 224. In the text of Eden on Injunctions, published in 1821, p. 259, the author says the jurisdiction of courts of equity in cases of purpresture and nuisance is undoubted; that it is founded on the right to restrain the exercise, or the erection, of that from which irreparable damage to individuals or great public injury would ensue. The extensive notes of Mr. Waterman (to c. 11, p. 259), in Wat. Ed. Inj., are valuable. And the distinction there taken is, that a public nuisance is one that annoys all the members of the common public alike, and that, although the injury may be to an interest which is open to the public, if it lay more heavily upon a particular individual, he may have his remedy by private suit in equity.\n\nIn cases where there is no special damage to single individuals more than is common to the public, the remedy must be by indictment, or by information in equity by the attorney-general. Nuisances, he says, are of two kinds, &#8212; those which are injurious to the public at large, and those which are injurious to the rights and interests of private persons. With regard to public nuisances, he says the jurisdiction seems to be of very ancient date, and to be on\nthe irreparable damage to individuals, or on the great public injury which is likely to ensue. The jurisdiction, he says, is applicable not only to nuisances strictly so called, but also to purprestures, citing 2d Inst. 38, 272; Harg. L. T. 84, 87.\n\nBlackstone (vol. 3, p. 73) says that the court of commissioners of the sewers, having chancery powers and jurisdiction to overlook and repair sea-banks and sea-walls, and the cleansing of rivers, public streams, etc., may proceed either with or without a jury, and remove obstacles, impose rates, and various other things. The fact is, that they usually proceeded without a jury, and while the high court of chancery was frequently called upon to restrain the action of this court of commissioners, it seldom, if ever, interfered.\n\nEden says (p. 266) that the commissioners of sewers, in the exercise of their duty to repair sea-banks and sea-walls, survey rivers, public streams, ditches, c., have authority to inquire of all nuisances and offences committed by the stopping of rivers, erecting mills, not repairing banks and bridges, c. These commissioners were latterly appointed by the court of chancery. See, also, Dore v. Gray, 2 T. R. 358 (1788); Yeaw v. Holland, 2 W. Bl. 717.\n\nThe case of Robinson v. Lord Byron, 1 Bro. Ch. 588, was a mandatory injunction against maintaining and using dams, wires, shuttles, flood-gates, and other erections so as to interrupt the flow of water of a stream which flowed to the plaintiff's mill.\n\nLord Chancellor Eldon, in 1802, in the course of his opinion in Universities of Oxford v. Richardson, 6 Ves. 706, in commenting upon Lord Byron's Case, says, &#8212; \"Suppose in the case of Lord Byron there had been a variety of mills upon the stream: I do not say that they would have a concurrent right in the use of the water, though they would in this sense, that each was to have it, but the court would have enjoined at the instance of any one, as he would have a complete title in himself.\" Thus Lord Chancellor Eldon, on whom the defendants rely in their argument with such confidence, recognizes the power of courts of equity to adjust water-rights, and no question is made as to the propriety of the exercise of power in such cases. And his ground is, that there is no question of title; and I maintain that the jurisdiction of such courts fully to hear and to regulate water-rights, where the title or right to use is conceded or established, is unquestioned.\n\nIn my examination of this question, I have not found an intimation by any writer to the contrary; nor have I seen a query by any court as to the propriety of exercising such power. Indeed, it is frequently &#8212; I ought to say always &#8212; said, that it is the only court that can adequately relieve from conditions and complications existing with reference to such interests. There is greater inherent necessity for full power in such cases than in matters of account, or any of the other matters commonly understood as within the province of courts of equity.\n\nIn Mayor of London v. Bolt, 5 Ves. 130, Lord Chancellor Loughborough\ngranted an injunction against a public nuisance in the city of London, but did it reluctantly, for the reason, as he said, that the Lord Mayor had ample jurisdiction to order the abatement. No other question was made by the chancellor.\n\nMr. Eden (p. 261), after speaking of the jurisdiction of the court of exchequer to try and determine purprestures, says that a bill was filed praying that the defendant might be restrained from making any further erections, and that those might be abated, which decree was made accordingly. Attorney-General v. Richards, 2 Anst. 603. The same thing was done in regard to Bristol Harbor (B. H. Case, cit. 18 Ves. 214, Attorney-General v. Forbes, Redes. Pl. 117); and an injunction was lately granted to restrain a purpresture and nuisance upon the Thames river. Attorney-General v. Johnson, 2 Wils. Ch. 87. Upon the same principle is the case mentioned by Lord Hardwicke, of an information by the attorney-general to restrain the stopping up of a highway behind the royal exchange. (Amb. 104.) This was a proceeding in equity upon information. Mr. Eden says (p. 262), &#8212; \"The jurisdiction in these cases might have been supported on the ground of public nuisance, even if the cause complained of had not at the same time been purprestures; the interposition in cases merely of public nuisance being by no means a modern branch of equitable jurisdiction.\"\n\nThere is a precedent for this in the time of Queen Elizabeth, which appears to have escaped observation. Bond's Case, Moore 238. Accordingly, no less than three of the above applications on grounds of public nuisance were at the suit of private individuals (Baines v. Baker, Amb. 158, 3 Atk. 21, 751), and Lord Hardwicke, in one of them, noticed the irregularity, which does not appear to have formed a very serious objection. (See Corning v. Lowerre, 6 Johns. Ch. 439, which was by information and bill combined.) \"All obstructions in public rivers by which the current is weakened, or the placing of timber or other bulky materials by which navigation is impeded, are nuisances.\" Eden 265.\n\nIn Bacon's day (5 Bac. Abr., Nuis. A), exhibiting horses in the streets was a nuisance, and might be abated. But I venture to say that in these modern days it would be deemed exceedingly arbitrary and in violation of sacred rights if the court should order that horses should not be exhibited or shown in the streets. \"As navigable rivers are deemed highways, it is a nuisance to divert part of the river whereby the current of it is weakened, and made unable to carry vessels of the same burden as it could before; also the laying of timber in a common river, though the soil belong to the party, is as clearly a nuisance as if the soil was not his, if thereby the passage of boats, etc., is obstructed.\" Bac. Abr., Nuis. A, ed. 1852, p. 227; Noy 103; 3 Keb. 640, 759.\n\nIt will be noted in this connection that Judge Smith takes the ground that the plaintiffs in the case at bar are not entitled to\nrelief, because the soil underlying the waters of the Connecticut river is owned by the riparian proprietors. The diversion of water by obstruction is a nuisance. It may be purely a private nuisance, or it may be in character public, with special injury to an individual, which makes it for purposes of remedy a private nuisance. The books are full of cases of equitable relief where remedy at law is inadequate. The court of chancery has also a concurrent jurisdiction with courts of law over nuisances private in character where there is no irreparable injury. There are many cases of application on this very subject of diverting streams.\n\nIn Finch v. Resbridger, 2 Vern. 390, the Lord Keeper held that after a long enjoyment of the water-course the right was to be presumed unless disproved by the other party, and the plaintiff was quieted in the enjoyment of his possession by injunction. In Bush v. Western, Prec. Ch. 530, a plaintiff who had been in possession for a long time of the water-course was quieted by injunction against the defendant, who had diverted it, though the plaintiff had not established his right at law, and the court said such bills were usual. See, also, 1 Vern. 120, East India Co. v. Sandys, 1 Vern. 127, 1 Vern. 275, 1 Ves. 476, 2 Ves. 414, 2 Atk. 391, 2 Ves. 453, 16 Ves. 338. Mr. Drewry's work on Injunctions, published about 1840, recognizes the jurisdiction of a court of equity to grant relief against nuisances. He lays down the doctrine, that where a nuisance is purely public, the proper course is by information filed by the attorney-general. He says, p. 240, &#8212; \"Where a case of nuisance is made producing private injury to the plaintiff, although it may also produce public injury, a bill for an injunction may be filed by the party suffering the private injury, and the attorney-general need not be made a party.\" Crowder v. Tinkler, 19 Ves. 617; Spencer v. Company, 8 Sim. 193. The same point was taken in Sampson v. Smith, 8 Sim. 272, where a demurrer was filed, alleging the act complained of to be both a private and a public nuisance, and the demurrer was for want of parties, the plaintiff being a private individual and the attorney-general not being joined. The demurrer was overruled, the vice-chancellor holding that the bill containing allegations of private nuisance, the allegation of public nuisance was immaterial, and did not make the attorney-general a necessary party. In Crowder v. Tinkler, 19 Ves. 618, Lord Chancellor Eldon says, &#8212; \"I incline to think that an injunction should be granted in this case under the head, not of nuisance, but of danger to property.\" And he refers to Lord Byron's Case, where an injunction was granted restraining the diversion of water. Later, the question came up before the same Lord Chancellor on notice to dissolve the injunction. After discussion he says, upon the question of injunction, &#8212; \"If the subject was represented as a mere public nuisance, I could not interfere in this case, as the attorney-general is not a party. The complaint is therefore to be considered as not a public nuisance simply,\nbut that being so in its nature is attended with extreme probability of irreparable injury to the property of the plaintiff, including danger to their existence, and on such a case clearly established I do not hesitate to say an injunction would be granted.\" Snell's Principles of Equity, p. 496, states the doctrine in a few words. Speaking of public nuisances pure and simple, it is said, &#8212; \"As a general rule a suit of this nature is instituted by the attorney-general, or he is made a party as representing the public. But when a private person suffers a special and peculiar injury, distinct from that of the public in general, in consequence of a public nuisance, he will be entitled to an injunction and relief in equity, and the attorney-general is not a necessary party to the action\" &#8212; citing Wood v. Sutcliffe, 2 Sim. N. S. 163, Corning v. Lowerre, 6 Johns. Ch. 439.\n\n\"The ownership of the crown in the soil of the shore is subservient to the public right of navigation, and cannot be used in any way so as to derogate from and interfere with such right. The grantees of the crown take subject to this light, and any grant to subject so as to be detrimental to the public right is void as to such parts as are open to such objections, if acted upon so as to effect nuisance by working injury to the public right. Attorney-General v. Parmeter, 10 Price 378, 412; Gann v. Whitstable, 11 H. L. 192; Attorney-General v. Burridge, 10 Price 350. All such nuisances may be abated on information.\" Coul.  F. Wat. 33.\n\nIn this country, a purpresture, if there is any such thing here (and it is of little consequence whether you call it purpresture, or nuisance, or a mixture), is coextensive with the American idea of navigable waters, and extends to inland rivers and streams. While the state does not retain any part of the soil, it does retain the right of public use. Gould Wat., s. 168; High Inj., s. 759; New Orleans v. United States, 10 Pet. 662; Mohawk Br. Co. v. Railroad, 6 Paige 554; Attorney-General v. Company, 6 Paige 133. \"The diversion or obstruction of a water-course has been the subject of frequent equitable interference by way of injunction both in England and America. . . . Another ground of equitable jurisdiction is the regulation of common rights in waters . . . And equity will call all the parties before it, if necessary to determine their respective rights and obligations by one decree.\" Gould Wat. 534, 540. This ground of jurisdiction does not depend upon nuisance or purpresture. \"The jurisdiction in this class of cases,\" says Gould, \"rests upon the inadequacy of legal remedies and the prevention of a multiplicity of suits.\"\n\n\"Equitable jurisdiction includes rights and interests in their nature equitable, as not being absolute, but qualified, conditional, or collateral, and in their nature rather of charges on, or qualifications of, some legal and absolute right.\" Finl. Jud. Sys. 108. It may be said that water-rights, where each must be exercised\nreasonably with reference to the other, are peculiarly within the reasoning of Finlason. At the common law any encroachment upon a public stream was considered to be a purpresture, &#8212; that is to say, the making of that several and private which ought to be common to many. 2 Inst. 38. And Glanvil calls the diversion of water from its right course a purpresture. Lib. 9, c. 11. But it should be observed that the power of the commissioners of sewers succeeded to the original jurisdiction possessed by justices appointed for the above purposes, and that their authority extended to alter and amend all annoyances of the description which we have mentioned, \"according [to use the words of the statute] to their wisdoms and discretions.\" 23 H. 8, c. 5, s. 3; Woolr. L. W. 196.\n\nThe position taken by Judge Smith, that the chancery powers and practice in England have been enlarged within fifty years, may be true if comparison is made with the period since about 1820. But it is also true that equity process was used more summarily and with greater vigor previous to 1800 than for the few years succeeding. Lord Eldon seems to have been a conservative man, and to have moved cautiously, and abridged somewhat remedial process during his day.\n\nAs to the numerous cases cited by counsel in support of his proposition that the defendants are entitled to a trial by jury whether the English or the provincial practice prevail, I have this to say, that they are not in point. In every instance, so far as I have been able to examine them, the question was either a distinct question of nuisance, or the title was in doubt; and in no case cited where the regulation of water-rights was a question, either independent of or connected with an alleged nuisance, was the relief denied. For instance, the Portsmouth Bridge Case, in 17 N.H. 200 , was in favor of the town rather than a party aggrieved, and was a distinct question of nuisance. Yet the court does not deny jurisdiction, but says under such circumstances the case must be clear.\n\nAttorney-General v. Cleaver, 18 Ves. 211, in Lord Eldon's day, was a distinct nuisance case. The nuisance complained of was an offensive trade. There was no allegation of irreparable damage, multiplicity of suits, or conceded rights. It was a pure question of fact whether the nuisance was offensive to the public. So as to 2 Sim. N. S. 133. The question was one of nuisance simply, with no allegation other than that the defendant was accustomed to ring a bell. Yet the chancellor says that equity has jurisdiction, and the fact that it is a simple question of nuisance is not a ground of demurrer; but the fact that it is a distinct question of nuisance with no imminent peril or irreparable injury alleged, may be equitable ground for refusing an injunction until the plaintiff gets a verdict at law. That is all this question amounts to in the defendants' direction; while the chancellor goes full length,\nciting numerous authorities in favor of the doctrine that the plaintiff having a special grievance may have his bill, and the attorney-general may join by way of information in equity. Soltau v. DeHeld, 2 Sim. N. S. 133, 151.\n\nLord Cottenham's Case, in 1 Craig  P. 299, was a bill to enjoin the defendant and the commissioners of sewers from issuing a precept. There were questions of legal right and construction. The injunction was continued, but title to the office being in dispute, it was suggested that the plaintiff forthwith bring an action at law to settle the right. There is no analogy here.\n\nIn Elmhirst v. Spencer, 2 Macn.  G. 45, the thing complained of was the diversion of a stream, but there was no allegation of irreparable damage or multiplicity of suits, and there was a distinct question of nuisance; and it did not appear that any actual damage had occurred or was likely to occur to the plaintiff, while an injunction would suspend the defendant's business. The headnote discloses all that is shown by the case, that a court of equity will not exercise its jurisdiction by injunction against an alleged nuisance without a previous trial at law, or without its being clearly proved that the plaintiff has sustained such substantial injury as would have entitled him to a verdict for damages in an action at law, leaving it to be inferred, of course, that if the plaintiff had suffered an injury such as would have entitled him to a verdict, its jurisdiction would be asserted. The temporary injunction was dissolved because the plaintiff had no case on his bill of evidence.\n\nThe case of Gas Co. v. Broadbent, 7 H. L. Cas. 600, was a nuisance case, and the complaint was that the defendant had moved his gasworks nearer than he had a right to. This involved legal questions as to rights, etc., and seemed to have been similar in this respect to Burnham v. Kempton, in New Hampshire, where the court says that if the plaintiff's title was conceded, there would be no doubt as to the right of the court to regulate the use. \"When he [the plaintiff] has established his right at law, I apprehend that, unless there is something special in the case, he is entitled to an injunction.\" And it may be observed here that there were no allegations of irreparable damage, multiplicity of suits, imminent peril, or regulation of conceded rights, as in the case under discussion. 7 H L. Cas. 612, Lord Kingsdown. The case of Irwin v. Dixion, 9 How. 10, was one of disputed title. My brother's quotation shows that.\n\nThe Wheeling Bridge Case, 13 How. 568, cited by the defendants, is a valuable case in many respects. The opinion was by McLean, J. There was no question of irreparable damage. It was a mere question of obstructing a navigable river. The question whether the bridge was a nuisance or an obstruction to the navigation of the Ohio river was in dispute. It was claimed it was no serious obstruction; that only seven steamboats out of two hundred\nand thirty which ply on the river as far up as Pittsburgh were obstructed; and that the obstruction arose from the height of their chimneys, which might be lowered at small expense, and that by the introduction of flues the chimneys might be shortened. As to Its being no obstruction, the court said that on this point there was no doubt, &#8212; the jury in such a case could give no aid to the pal ties, and find the bridge to be a nuisance; and hold that where there is a private injury (irreparable in its character) from a public nuisance, the court of equity will interfere by injunction.\n\n[Counsel here discussed, &#8212; 1. The irreparable damage feature of the bill. 2. The allegation as to multiplicity of suits. 3. And alluded to that feature of the answer which attacks the plaintiffs' business, and insisted upon the right of the plaintiffs to utilize the property they own. The plaintiffs must know whether they can have a right of way when needed for purposes of navigation, and whether they can have all the water of the Connecticut in its natural channel.]\n\nIn view of the complaints of the defendants as to this proceeding, I desire to say that if such a dam had been constructed over the navigable waters of England in the period of 1792, to which counsel are pleased to refer, it would have been abated in an hour by the court of commissioners, upon affidavits and view, without a jury. The case of Bush v. Western, Prec. Ch. 530, cited by the defendants, was in favor of a party who had been in possession of a water-course for sixty years, and was a bill for perpetual injunction to quiet the plaintiff's possession, which the defendant had interrupted by making a cut or channel through his own land. The defendant objected, upon the ground that the right was not first settled at law. The court, upon the ground that the plaintiff's case was clear (not, however, conceded or established), held that such proceedings were usual, citing Lord Aylesford's Case, and decreed for the plaintiff. Finch v. Resbridger, 2 Vern. 390, was a water case, and to the same effect. My brother does not quote quite correctly, or, at least, with sufficient fulness, from s. 854 of 2 Story, as to Bills of Peace. The quotation should be, &#8212; \"Courts of equity, therefore, having the power to bring all the parties before them, will at once proceed to the ascertainment of the general right, and, if it be necessary, they will ascertain it by an action or issue at law.\" The question of necessity is to be determined by the court. The first part of the paragraph above quoted would seem to have been overlooked. It probably is not necessary for me to take the point, that in any matter within the jurisdiction of the court to try to regulate, all other questions will be determined. This is a familiar doctrine in New Hampshire, and it is not necessary to cite authorities in support thereof.\n\nThe point taken by the defendants, that the king owned the soil under these waters, is of no moment. It makes no difference whether, as a legal question, the government (in other words, the\npublic) owns the soil, as in England, or whether the government reserves the right of use to the public, as in this country. The question here is, and the only question is, as to how it was used and practised to regulate water-rights in which members of the public were interested, prior to 1792, whether in courts of equity, or by action at law with a jury. It is the practice, and the practice only, that we have to look at. Whether you call them purprestures or nuisances, or both, or whether the title to the soil was here or there, is of the merest consequence in the world.\n\nThe question is, how such rights were settled, &#8212; whether at law, or in equity. And if we establish our claim that the exception in art. 20 referred to the English practice, and if we find, upon examination of such practice, that water-rights in which the public were interested were invariably settled in equity upon a bill in equity, or by information in equity, or both, depending upon whether the grievance was specially burdensome to individuals, or rested upon the public at large, then our position is sound, that this class of cases is within the exception in art. 20, and that the right of trial by jury does not exist.\n\nIn the case of Attorney-General v. Burridge, 10 Price 350, the same question was raised. This was an information in the nature of a bill in equity, and was to the same effect. The point is distinctly held, that the court has jurisdiction and may determine the question itself, or in its discretion make an issue for the jury Richards, Lord Chief Baron, says (p. 374), &#8212; \"This is, in my opinion, a very proper proceeding for the purpose and object of the suit, and there are precedents for it without number. . . . where, however, if the court cannot determine without such assistance [a jury], an issue may be properly directed to assist, not to control, the determination of the court. In such cases a jury is always a necessary medium for dispelling doubt or dificulty [difficulty].\" Bond's Case, Moore 238, decided in the Exchequer 29 Elizabeth (1687), is disposed of by brother Smith by saying that the land on which the pigeon-house was erected was crown land.\n\nWhen we are looking to the question as to where and how it was practised to try these questions, what difference does it make whether the land belonged to the king or to Sallyette Brown? The title in the crown merely goes to the matter of who should be plaintiff, &#8212; whether the attorney-general for the public at large, or in the name of the private party who had a special injury. In either case the practice was to present the grievance in equity, and for equity to grant relief without a jury. Such was the use and practice, and it matters little as to what court. The question, as I have said, is, How was it used to regulate such rights &#8212; with a jury, or without? It is the fact in this respect that determines whether they are within the exception, or within the granting part of the clause. In Attorney- General v. Forbes, 2 Myl.  C. 123, Lord. Chancellor Cottenham reviews this question of jurisdiction\nand practice. This was a case of apprehended nuisance. The case of Attorney-General v. Company, 6 Paige 133, 135, was similar to the one at bar. It was alleged that the Cohoes company had cut through the embankment of the Mohawk river in New York for the purpose of drawing water from the canal for the supply of their mills, and it was claimed that if they were not restrained the plaintiffs would be deprived of the necessary supply of water to carry on their business. There was a temporary injunction, which was afterwards made perpetual on hearing. The court said, in the course of the opinion, that the court of chancery has jurisdiction to restrain any purpresture, or unauthorized appropriation of the public property to private use.\n\nIt will be observed, that in none of the English cases as to regulation of water-rights, or of nuisance, or of purpresture, was the trial by Jury in equity thought of or claimed. Whatever claims were made about it were made as to the jurisdiction of courts of equity over such subjects, and by way of objection that the fact should be settled by proceedings at law. And the practice was universal as to water-rights, and as to all nuisances when the peril was imminent, or the injury irreparable in character, to hear and determine in equity without a jury. And I do not remember of seeing a case where an issue of fact relative to such right was tried by Jury in such a proceeding.\n\nNow, we claim the practice to have been, as to cases within the jurisdiction of such courts, not to frame and direct issues of fact to be tried by a jury, except in cases where, upon the evidence and hearing, the chancellor had doubt, and where his conscience was not settled, &#8212; and then the verdict was not conclusive or binding; and there are numerous instances where the chancellor decreed otherwise than the verdict.\n\nMr. Proffat (Jury Trials, s. 90), in speaking of the English right of trial by jury in equity proceedings, says, &#8212; \"As a matter of right, a Jury trial could not be claimed in a court of equity except in two instances. These cases were where an heir-at-law was sought to be divested of his inheritance under a will, and the other case was where the right of a rector to the tithes of his parish was contested. The granting of an issue for a trial by jury was in all other cases entirely a matter for the discretion of the court. See, also, Dan. Ch. 1075; Van Alst v. Hunter, 5 Johns. Ch. 148; Cahoon v. Levy,  5 Cal. 294 ; Rogers v. Rogers, 3 Wend. 503; Middleton v. Sherburne, 4 Y.  C. Ex. 358; Sneed v. Ewing, J. J. Marsh. 460; Short v. Lee, 2 Jac.  W. 464, 496; Harrod v. Harrod, 18 Jurist 853; Gray v. Haig, 20 Beav. 219; Robinson v. Anderson, 7 De G. M.  G. Bank. 239; Young v. Fernie, 1 De G. J.  S. Bank. 353; Jer. Eq. 298, 299; 2 Dan. Ch 1289.\n\nThe practice has been universal, where the title or right to use is clear, or where the right is conceded or established, to hear,\ndetermine, and regulate the manner of using water. The jurisdiction is grounded in the inherent necessity of the situation, upon inadequacy of remedy at law, and upon the ground that it promotes justice to the parties and avoids a multiplicity of actions at law. And it has been the practice of American courts of equity to abate, or order the removal or non-use of, obstructions upon proceedings to that end.\n\nI would call attention to the cases cited as to relief in favor of the paramount right of navigation in Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts; also, in favor of the proposition that courts of equity will afford relief from danger arising from a threatened public nuisance to a person who may suffer a special injury thereby, or to abate those already existing.\n\nBispham, Principles of Equity 20-25, speaks of the class of states in which, after the separation from the British crown, courts of equity were created by the constitution, fashioned after the high court of chancery, which he calls the first class; and the second class are states where the courts have been created by the legislatures under the constitution, and administer equity according to the course and practice of chancery. As has been already observed, in 1867 the legislature of New Hampshire (unnecessarily, as we claim) added the subjects of waste and nuisance to those already enumerated as within the jurisdiction of courts of equity.\n\nMr. Pomeroy, in his work on Equity Jurisprudence, says, s. 299, that while the equitable jurisdiction of New Hampshire is not, in extent, exactly commensurate with the English court of chancery, yet so far as it does extend, and with respect to all matters embraced within its scope, it is identical with the jurisdiction held by any court of general equitable powers.\n\nOne other claim made by counsel for the defendants is, that, while there were no equity courts in New Hampshire and hence no public equity suits to abate public nuisances, there was a perfectly efficacious remedy by indictment.\n\nMy answer to this is, that if there was an equity court in New Hampshire with general powers, the proceeding by indictment was merely cumulative; and whether there was a court of equity or not in the province, the exception, in art. 20, of cases from the guaranty of jury trials could not have had reference to public prosecutions by indictment, which at common law were triable by jury.\n\nBispham says, s. 443, discussing English and American purprestures, that in this country a bill in equity to abate a public nuisance, filed by one who has sustained special damage, has succeeded to the former mode in England of an information in chancery, prosecuted on behalf of the crown, to abate or enjoin a nuisance; and that the jurisdiction of courts of chancery over such matters is well established in this country.\n\nThe difference in the mode of procedure comes from title in the\ncrown, but in both instances the practice was to try purprestures in equity. And the use and practice are what we are after.\n\nSo I take issue with counsel for the defendants on his claim that the constitutional right of trial by jury exists in New Hampshire in all causes in equity, and maintain that it never existed as a matter of constitutional right as to any cause or question within the jurisdiction of such court.\n\nEven under Marston v. Brackett the right was in a sense qualified, as it was for the court to say what was deemed essential and material to the decision. But Marston v. Brackett was contrary to authority and reason, because the exception in the Bill of Rights had reference to the English system of practice in equity, and trial by jury never existed there as a matter of right even in nuisance cases. As to distinct nuisance questions, if the cause embraced the element of irreparable damage or multiplicity of suits, the court always exercised jurisdiction; and in nuisance cases where these elements were not involved, and it was a distinct and sole question of fact whether the nuisance existed, the court frequently exercised jurisdiction and control, and at other times did not; but it was always a matter of discretion, depending upon emergency and imminency of peril.\n\nAnd as to water-rights, it was the universal and unquestioned practice in courts of equity to determine and regulate without a Jury the manner of use in all cases where the plaintiff's title was either conceded, or established at law. So we say, drawing our light from and being governed by the English rules of practice, such right of trial does not exist in New Hampshire.\n\nIn Connecticut, though a bill in equity for an injunction against a public nuisance in navigable waters will not generally be sustained in favor of a private individual having no special interest, yet, where the party complaining will sustain an injury distinct from that done to the public at large, and especially if it be irreparable and a court of law cannot afford adequate relief, this relief will be granted. Frink v. Lawrence,  20 Conn. 117 . The court, per Waste, J., said, &#8212; \"We have had occasion, in several recent cases, to consider the question whether a private individual can sustain a bill in equity for an injunction against a public nuisance in navigable waters. Bigelow v. Bridge Co.,  14 Conn. 565 ; O'Brien v. Railroad Co.,  17 Conn. 372 ; Seeley v. Bishop,  19 Conn. 135 . And we held that such relief will not be granted, unless it appears that the party complaining will sustain special or peculiar damage &#8212; an injury distinct from that to the public at large. But, on the other hand, it was conceded that if such damage would accrue, the relief might be granted. Indeed, such now seems to be the well recognized rule in equity, especially where the object is to prevent some irreparable injury, for which under the circumstances of the case, the law cannot afford adequate remedy.\" City of Georgetown v. Canal Co., 12 Pet. 98; Corning\nv. Lowerre, 6 Johns. Ch. 439; Crowder v. Tinkler, 19 Ves. 616; 2 Sto. Eq. 203, 204.\n\nI submit a few authorities upon the question of regulation of water-rights and of mandatory injunctions. Gould Wat., ss. 552-555; ib., ss. 127-129; ib., ss. 534-540; Walker v. Shepardson,  2 Wis. 284 , and authorities cited on 390; River Imp. Company v. Lyons,  30 Wis. 61 ; People v. St. Louis,  10 Ill. 351 ; Minke v. Hopeman,  87 Ill. 451 ; Mayor v. Jaques, 30 Geo. 506; Attorney-General v. Hunter, 1 Dev. Eq. 12. A case in New York was so like the one in question, and the relief granted was of such practical utility, that I feel justified in stating it: \"In the early settlement of the city of Rochester, on the Genesee river, in western New York, a gentleman named Brown owned the bed of the Genesee river immediately above the main fall, &#8212; a perpendicular fall nearly one hundred feet high, within the limits of the city, &#8212; and also a strip of land extending from these falls along the west bank of the river for a mile or more. He built a dam across the river a few rods above the falls, and constructed a mill-race or canal leading from this dam about a mile down the river, on its west side, parallel to and a few hundred feet from the river bank, which was through this whole length a perpendicular cliff nearly one hundred feet high. One of the finest water-powers in the country was thus obtained and utilized. The space between this mill canal and the west bank of the river he divided into a large number of mill lots, perhaps one hundred in all, varying in width, each abutting at its front end on the mill canal, and at its rear end on the perpendicular bank of the river. These lots, together with the right to draw a certain amount of the water from the mill canal, were from time to time conveyed in fee to different grantees, each grantee covenanting to use only the amount of water specified in his deed of conveyance. In process of time, all the lots had thus been sold and conveyed in fee, and Brown, the original owner, retained no interest whatever in the property. A continuous line of mills and manufactories had been built on these lots along the bank of the river; many of the lots had passed to subsequent grantees, and there were perhaps one hundred different proprietors of mill lots, all holding under the original conveyances from Brown. There was, of course, no privity of contract between these various grantees and lot-owners, and since Brown had conveyed each lot in fee, and had retained no reversionary interest whatever, there was no privity of estate among the various grantees and proprietors of different mill lots. When the Genesee river was high, there was an ample supply of water for the needs of all the mills and manufactories. But during a large portion of each year, while the natural flow of the river was lessened, the supply of water through the mill canal was diminished; and in consequence of this the lot-owners on the upper part of the canal diverted and consumed more of the water than the proportionate amounts to which\nthey were entitled. This practice of unlawful consumption was carried on to such an extent that the supply of water was largely cut off from the lots on the lower part of the canal, and a very serious loss was thereby occasioned to the owners. For all this injury there was no adequate remedy at law. In this condition the owner of a mill at the lower end of the canal brought a suit in equity, making all the other proprietors and occupants of mills bordering on the canal defendants, and setting out facts showing the titles and water-rights of each separate and individual lot, for the purpose of obtaining a decree establishing and quieting the title of each proprietor on the canal to divert and use the waters. Such a decree was rendered. It established the right of each proprietor to use the proportionate amount of water conveyed by his original deed; it definitely fixed these amounts; it determined the number of feet or inches of water which could be drawn from the canal for each lot, and the size of the opening through which the water could flow; and it provided for constructing permanent barriers and gates for each lot, by means of which the amount drawn from the canal for the use of the lot might be controlled and regulated. In order to make the decision final and perpetual, and to secure and protect the rights of all thus determined, the decree provided for the appointment and maintenance of a perpetual commission representing all the proprietors on the canal, who should possess the power to inspect the water-supply gates and openings of each lot, and to preserve inviolate the water-rights and the water-supply of each lot as they had thus been finally established by the decree of the court.\n\n\"It is true, the stream in this case was an artificial canal; but as there was no privity of contract nor of estate among all the different lot-owners on the canal, their relations with each other, so far as the jurisdiction of equity is concerned, were virtually the same as those which subsist between the different riparian proprietors upon any natural stream. The principle is the same in both cases. We have no doubt that on the same principle, in a suit brought by one private riparian proprietor against all the other similar proprietors upon any given stream, a court of equity might establish their rights as among themselves to use the water for irrigation, the amounts which each could divert, and the order, times, and seasons of his diversion, and might appoint a perpetual commission, representing all the proprietors on that stream, which should have power to carry into effect the provisions of the decree.\" Pom.
