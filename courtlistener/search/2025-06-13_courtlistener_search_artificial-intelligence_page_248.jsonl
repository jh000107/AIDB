(2) The court erred in overruling defendant's demurrer because plaintiff's injuries, if any, were the direct result of an accident or series of accidents; and, since both parties had elected to come under and be governed by the Workmen's Compensation Law, the court below was entirely without jurisdiction to entertain this cause. Sec. 3695, R.S. 1939; Downey v. Kansas City Gas Co.,  338 Mo. 803 , 92 S.W.2d 580 ; McKay v. Delico Meat Products Co.,  351 Mo. 876 , 174 S.W.2d 149 ; Vogt v.

App. 653 ,  55 S.W.2d 729 ; Seattle Can Co. v. Department of Labor, 256 P. 739. (3) The court erred in overruling defendant's demurrer because there was no proof that the sour crude oil transported by the defendant contained or emitted hydrogen sulphide gas in harmful quantities or concentrations sufficient to produce the diseases of fibrosis of the lungs and enlargement of the heart. Sec. 10212, R.S. 1939. (4) The court erred in overruling the defendant's demurrer because there was no proof that any device, means or method for the prevention of the inhalation of hydrogen sulphide gas was used or had been recognized as necessary to use by the pipe line industry or in similar industries, under similar conditions, and in similar places.

(5) The court erred in giving plaintiff's Instruction I because it was misleading and confusing in that it permitted a recovery upon an insufficient finding, and permitted a recovery based upon the defendant's failure to provide devices, means or methods concerning which there was no evidence. Secs. 10211, 10212, R.S. 1939; Smith v. Harbison-Walker Refractories Co.,  340 Mo. 389 , 100 S.W.2d 909 . (6) The evidence fails to establish any basis for the verdict and judgment thereon.

Franken, D.D. Thomas, Jr., Crawford  Harlan  and  George  H. Miller  for respondent.\n\n(1) The court properly overruled defendant's demurrer because there was ample evidence and substantial proof that plaintiff was suffering from fibrosis of the lungs and enlargement of the heart or cardiac hypertrophy and that said diseases were the direct result of plaintiff's work. Upon this proof the question of whether or not plaintiff was suffering from an occupational disease, was purely a question for the jury. Plank v. R.J.

(2) The court properly overruled defendant's demurrer because plaintiff's injuries were the direct result of the slow and chronic absorption of hydrogen sulphide gas and were not the result of an accident, and consequently not within the jurisdiction of the Workmen's Compensation Commission. Evans v. Chevrolet Motor Co.,  232 Mo. App. 927 ,  105 S.W.2d 1081 ; Plank v. R.J. Brown Petroleum Co.,  332 Mo. 1150 ,  61 S.W.2d 328 ; Langeneckert v.

Creston Auto Co.,  281 N.W. 189 . (3) There was substantial evidence that the sour crude oil transported by defendant contained and emitted hydrogen sulphide gas in harmful quantities and sufficient to produce plaintiff's injuries. Langeneckert v. St. Louis Sulphur  Chemical Co., 65 S.W.2d 648; Wagner Electric Corp. v. Snowden,  38 F.2d 599 . (4) The court did not err in overruling defendant's demurrer to the evidence as there was substantial evidence that certain devices, means or methods for the prevention of the inhalation of hydrogen sulphide gas was used or had been recognized as necessary to use by the pipe line industry under similar conditions. Smith v. Harbison-Walker Refractories Co.,  340 Mo. 389 ,  100 S.W.2d 909 ; Grange v. Chicago  E.I. Ry. Co.,  334 Mo. 1040 ,  69 S.W.2d 955 ; Walter v. Alt,  348 Mo. 53 ,  152 S.W.2d 135 ; Smith v.

It, together with Instruction II, required the jury to find all the elements necessary for a recovery, based upon the pleadings and proof. Sec. 10211, R.S. 1939; Rishel v. Kansas City Pub. Serv.
