Trial by jury and verdict for the plaintiff. Transferred from the January term, 1908, of the superior court by Plummer, J., on the defendants' exceptions to the denial of their motions for a nonsuit and the direction of a verdict in their favor.\n\nThe evidence tended to prove the following facts: The plaintiff was injured on December 26, 1905, in the defendants' finishing room where she was employed. She was intelligent, thirty-seven years old, and had been employed in the same room for eighteen months prior to the accident, during which period she had worked in the room 373 full days. About forty-five people worked in the room, which was 108 feet long and seventy feet wide. The room contained no machinery, but was equipped with rows of tables with passageways between them. Bolts of cloth were brought into the room on trucks and unloaded on the tables, where they were banded and papered, the latter operation consisting in wrapping them in paper to protect the cloth from dust. The cloth was then reloaded upon the trucks and removed. All the work was done in an orderly and systematic manner. There were places in the room to which the trucks were removed when empty. Trucks were used all about the room, but when empty they were not permitted to remain in the passageways. The rule required them to be removed to the place reserved for them, and it was not customary to leave them elsewhere. The room was lighted solely by incandescent electric lamps. On the day of the plaintiff's injury the light was turned on between two and three o'clock in the afternoon and was extinguished about twenty minutes before six o'clock by the melting of a fuse near the dynamo. The lamps on such a system are liable to be extinguished in this way, and these lights had failed twice before during the fall months. Such systems are in common use. The fuse is a safety device universally employed. When the location of a melted fuse is known, a new one can be substituted in a few minutes. The defendants had an available supply of fuses to replace any which might melt, and an employee whose duty it was to make the repair. There was no evidence of defect in the lighting system. The plaintiff was a\npaperer. After the lights failed she remained at her table and papered a bolt of cloth. Thinking she would have time to go to the water closet, she started across the room for that purpose, and was proceeding through one of the passageways when she fell over a truck and received the injuries for which she seeks to recover.", "procedural_history": "", "scdb_id": "", "sibling_ids": [3554838], "source": "ZU", "status": "Published", "suitNature": "", "syllabus": ""}
