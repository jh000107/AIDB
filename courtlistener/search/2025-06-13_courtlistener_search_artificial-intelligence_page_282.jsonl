Welch,  of Laurel, Grievance Committee, State Bar Association,  Louis M. Jiggitts,  Secretary, and  George Butler, \nall of Jackson, for appellant.\n\nThe authorities are numerous condemning the very actions of the defendant in the transaction about which this disbarment proceeding has been instituted. The courts have gone so far as to hold that any conduct which tends to bring reproach upon the legal profession or alienate the favorable opinion which the public should entertain concerning it, is sufficient ground for disbarment.\n\nWernimont v. State,  101 Ark. 210 , 142 S.W. 194; Ann. Cas. 1913d 1153; Garfield v. U.S., 32 App. (D.C.) 109; State v. Martin,  45 Wn. 76 , 87 P. 1054.\n\nThat the defendant is guilty of blackmail, the record conclusively shows.\n\nBlackmail is grounds for disbarment.\n\nPeople v. Varnum,  28 Colo. 349 , 64 P. 202.\n\nOr aiding a client in carrying through a scheme in the nature of blackmail is grounds for disbarment.\n\nMatter of Harrington,  146 App. Div. 219 , 130 N.Y.S. 920.\n\nThat the transaction, or a part of it, occurred outside of the state, is immaterial.\n\n2 R.C.L. 1098, sec. 191; People v. Gilman,  214 Ill. 569 , 73 N.E. 737, 69 L.R.A. 701; People v. McCauley,  230 Ill. 208 , 82 N.E. 612; 120 A.S.R. 287.\n\nThe entire conduct of the defendant in this case shows him to be unfit to enjoy the privileges of a practicing attorney.\n\n2 R.C.L. 1089, sec. 181.\n\nNo attorney at law should be permitted to engage in or continue in a course of conduct which brings the profession into disrepute. The right to practice law is merely a privilege, which may be revoked for conduct rendering one unfit to hold a license to practice.\n\n31 A.L.R. 737; 2 R.C.L. 940; 1 R.C.L. Supp. 664.\n\nIf the court learns, after the admission of an attorney to practice law, that he is no longer to be trusted, its duty\nis, on proper application, to see that he ceases to be held out as worthy of professional employment.\n\n50 A.L.R. 380; Fairfield County Bar Ex rel. Samuel Fessenden et al. v. Howard W. Taylor,  60 Conn. 11 , 13 L.R.A. 767.\n\nWhether or not the conduct of the defendant was part of the scheme to extract money from Warren Brothers, either by threatening them with an anti-trust suit, or by delivering to them documents which had been stolen, or documents which were in the hands of the defendant for the purpose of being used as evidence against Warren Brothers in an anti-trust suit for the benefit of the state is immaterial, for whichever of these purposes used, and it is certain from the record that at least one, if not all of them, were used and money received therefor was fraudulently received, such conduct is sufficient to disbar the respondent.\n\n6 C.J., sec. 58, page 599; People v. Keegan,  18 Colo. 237 , 36 Am. St. Rep. 234.\n\n T.J. Wills,  of Hattiesburg, and  Charles F. Engle,  of Natchez, for appellee.\n\nIn the case of Ex Parte Redmond, reported in  125 So. 833 , No. 28044, on the Docket of this court, this court has announced as clear, as reasonable, and as logical an exposition of the law as it is possible to find in the books. The court has announced in that case that the respondent is entitled to the benefit of every reasonable doubt; that the evidence sustaining the charge should be clear and convincing, not only as to sustaining actual facts charged, but as to the culpability of the respondent and his bad motives.\n\nIn the Matter of Mashbir,  44 App. Div. 632 , Mem. 60 N.Y.S. 451.\n\nThe court should never disbar a lawyer on testimony of a doubtful character.\n\nTudor v. Com., 84 S.W. 522, 27 Ky. L. 87; Dempsey v. Wells, 109 Mo. App. 470, 84 S.W. 1015.\n\nWhere the evidence on proceedings for disbarment is substantially conflicting the accused will be given the benefit of the doubt.\n\nIn re Stephens,  84 Cal. 77 , 24 P. 46.\n\nTo authorize the disbarment of an attorney upon such a charge as is made in the instant case, the proof must be clear, both as to the act charged against the attorney and his corrupt motive.\n\nState ex rel. Rude v. Young,  30 Fla. 85 , 11 So. 514; State ex rel. Fowler v. Finley,  30 Fla. 325 , 11 So. 674, 18 L.R.A. 401; Zachary v. State, 43 So. 925; Newby (1908), 82 Nebr. 235, 117 N.W. 691.\n\nThe presumption is in favor of the integrity of the bar; and on the great issue of the honesty or depravity of an attorney the rule of authority and reason is that the court should require the charge of depravity to be established by the clear preponderance of the evidence.\n\nEx Parte Gadsen,  89 S.C. 352 ,  71 S.E. 952 ; Re F.H. Reily, 183 P. 728 , 7 A.L.R. 89.\n\nThe power of the court to disbar an attorney is to be used in moderation and only on clear proof. Not only must the acts of misconduct charged be proved, but fraudulent or dishonest motives must also be satisfactorily and clearly proved.\n\nPeople v. Pio,  308 Ill. 128 , 139 N.E. 45; People v. Lasley, 302 Ill. 595 , 135 N.E. 50; People v. Barrios,  237 Ill. 527 , 86 N.E. 1075; People ex rel. Chicago Bar Association v. A. Brunswick, 315 Ill. 442 ,  146 N.E. 486 .\n\nNot a single charge in the petition against the respondent is supported by the evidence. He did not settle a state case; he did not sell papers needed by the state for the prosecution of a case; he could not have secured the\nsecret abandonment of an anti-trust suit; and both he and Mr. Crafts, the only person with whom respondent dealt, testified without contradiction that he did not blackmail Warren Brothers Company. He violated no law; and no one was injured through his fault. If the amount paid in the Durant settlement was disportionately large, the respondent did not know any of the details of the controversy, including the financial magnitude of the contract in question; and he is inevitably released from all culpability on that score by the testimony to the effect that he accepted the amount offered by Mr. Crafts, and received it only because Mr. Crafts requested him not to sever connection with the matter.\n\nArgued orally by  Jeff Truly, George Butler  and  W.S.
