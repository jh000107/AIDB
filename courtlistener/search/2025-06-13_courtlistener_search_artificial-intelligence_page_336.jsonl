Standard Oil Co. v. Southern Pac. Co., 268 U.S. 146 ; McCardle v. Indianapolis Water Co.,  272 U.S. 400 ; Simpson v. Shepherd,  230 U.S. 352 ; Bluefield Water Works  Imp. Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm.  262 U.S. 679 ; State ex rel. v. Pub. Serv. Comm.,  262 U.S. 276 . (3) The rate base must include all property necessary to meet the demands of the service at present and over a reasonable future period. (a) The law imposes on the utility a heavy burden of care and skill in the conduct of its business. Sipple v. Laclede Gas Light Co.,  125 Mo. App. 81 ; Nomath Hotel Co. v. Gas Co.,  204 Mo. App. 214 ; Brauer v. Gas Co., 238 S.W. 519. (b) The law requires the utility to consider and prepare for future demands and to build new property where necessary to render the service. Oklahoma G.

(d) In view of the strict requirements of the law as to the duty of the utility to meet the demands of the service, both present and future, the rate base should include reasonable reserve and stand-by equipment, even though the same may not actually be in use at the moment of valuation. Department of Public Works v. Gray's Harbor Co., P.U.R. 1932A, 140; Customers v. Cohoes P.  L. Co., P.U.R. 1921D, 421; In re Midwest Power Co., P.U.R. 1922E, 22; Alpha Portland Cement Co. v. Lehigh Elec. Co., P.U.R. 1924E, 737. (e) Where the utility has built and put into service property necessary to serve the demands of the customers in the past, such property should not be excluded from the rate base merely on a showing that the demands of the consumers have lessened during a period of depression, where a reasonable foresight indicates that upon the improvement of conditions the demand will again increase and the property again be necessary. City of Detroit v. Detroit Edison Co., P.U.R. 1933E, 193; Department of Public Works v. Seattle Gas Co., 3 P.U.R. (N.S.) 433; In re Richmond L., H.  P. Co., P.U.R. 1917B, 300. (4) If the sudden occurrence of a new source of supply permanently renders unnecessary items of property, previously built\nbecause necessary to the service when built, and if the new source of supply results in a reduction in the rates, the property thus rendered unnecessary should be amortized out of the savings due to the reduction in rates.

(2) Original, as well as reproduction, cost must be considered in determining the rate base; reproduction cost is but a guide, and not the measure of fair value, and is only of service if reasonably applied. Minnesota Rate Cases,  230 U.S. 452 , 57 L.Ed. 1556; Dayton P.  L. Co. v. Pub. Utils. Comm.,  292 U.S. 290 , 54 Sup. Ct. 647, 3 P.U.R. (N.S.) 294; Los Angeles Gas  E. Corp. v.

(3) The value of the company's land is its fair market value for all available uses, as measured by the fair average, normal value of the land in the immediate vicinity and having the same general characteristics, and not its value for any particular or special use. If the land has a peculiar value or special adaptation for a particular use, that is an element to be considered, but still the inquiry is as to its fair market value.

Boyd,  General Counsel, and  Daniel C. Rogers, \nAssistant Counsel, for Public Service Commission.\n\nKeeping in view the cumbersome record and attempting to confine the brief and argument on the part of the respondent Commission to a limitation, we shall attempt to analyze the report of the Commission that is sought to be declared unlawful and unreasonable. Corporate History. There is no need of discussing the corporate history as set out in the Commission's report because no contention is made concerning the facts therein stated. Financial Structure. The same may be said concerning the statement of facts and finding of the Commission as to financial structure. Historical Cost of Property. The appellant, Laclede Gas Light Company, comments a great\ndeal upon the prudent investment cost. By carefully reading what the Commission actually said, it will be observed that what they meant by prudent investment was an estimated investment of the physical property, exclusive of lands, to December 31, 1923, and that was said in reference to the Commission's engineers in Case No. 1673. From the records of the company the Commission's accountants determined the investment in lands from December 31, 1923.", "caseName": "State Ex Rel. City of St. Louis v.

J.\u2014The Act of April, 1858, \u201cfor the better observance of the Sabbath,\u201d is in conflict with the first and fourth sections of article first of the Constitution of this State, and is therefore void.</p> <p>The Constitution, when it forbids discrimination or preference in religion, does not mean merely to guarantee toleration, but religious liberty in its largest sense, and a perfect equality without distinction between religious sects. The enforced observance of a day held sacred by one df these sects, is a discrimination in favor of that sect, and a violation of the religious freedom of the others.</p> <p>Considered as a municipal regulation, the Legislature has no right to forbid or enjoin the lawful pursuit of a lawful occupation on one day of the week, any more than it can forbid it altogether.</p> <p>The governmental power only extends to restraining each one in the freedom of his conduct so as to secure perfect protection to all others from every species of danger to person, health, and property; that each individual shall be required so to use his own as not to inflict injury upon his neighbor; and these seem to be all the immunities which can be justly claimed by one portion of society from another, under a government of constitutional limitation.</p> <p>The act in question is in intention and effect a discrimination in favor of one religious profession over all others, and as such is in violation of the C(institution.</p> <p>Per Burnett, J.\u2014Our constitutional theory regards all religions, as such, as equally entitled to protection, and equally unentitled to preference. When there is no ground or necessity upon which a principle can rest but a religious one, then the Constitution steps in and says that it shall not be enforced by authority of law.</p> <p>The Sunday law violates this provision of the Constitution, because it establishes a compulsory religious observance. It violates as much the religious freedom of the Christian as of the Jew. The principle is the same, whether the act compels us to do what we wish to do or what we wish not to do.</p> <p>If the Legislature has the power to establish a day of compulsory rest, it has the right . to select the particular day.</p> <p>The protection of the Constitution extends to every individual or to none. It is the individual that is intended to be protected. Every citizen has the right to vote and worship as he pleases, without having his motives impeached in any tribunal of the State. When the citizen is sought to be compelled by the Legislature to do any affirmative religious act, or to refrain from doing anything because it violates simply a religious principle or observance, the act is unconstitutional.</p> <p>The constitutional question is a naked question of legislative power, and the inquiry as to the reasons which operated on the minds of members in voting for the measure, is wholly immaterial.</p> <p>If section first of article first of the Constitution asserts a principle not susceptible of practical application, then it may admit of a question whether any principle asserted in the declaration of rights can-be the subject of judicial enforcement. And if such a position be true that the rights of property can not be enforced by the Courts against an act of the Legislature, a power is then conceded which renders the provisions of the other sections wholly inoperative.</p> <p>The right to possess and protect property is not more clearly protected by the Constitution, than the right to acquire it. The right to acquire is the right to use the proper means to attain the end; and the use of such means, can not be prohibited by the Legislature, except the peace and safety of the State require it. *</p> <p>Free agents must be left free, as to themselves. If they can not be trusted to regulate their own labor, its times, and quantity, it is difficult to trust them to make their own contracts. If the Legislature can prescribe the days of rest for them, it would seem that the same power can prescribe the hours to work, rest, and eat.</p> <p>Per Field, X, dissenting,\u2014The \u201cAct to provide for the better observance of the Sabbath,\u201d is not\u2019In conflict with the fourth section of article one of the Constitution, which declares that \u201cthe free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship without discrimination or preference, shall for ever be allowed in this State.\u201d</p> <p>The act establishes, as a civil regulation, a day of rest from secular pursuits, and that is its only scope and purpose. It treats of business matters, not religious duties. In limiting its command to secular pursuits it necessarily leaves religious profession and worship free.</p> <p>It is not the province of the judiciary to pass upon the wisdom and policy of legislation; and when it does so, it usurps a power not conferred by the Constitution.</p> <p>The object of the act is not to protect those who can rest at their pleasure, but to afford rest to those who need it, and who, from the conditions of society, could not otherwise obtain it.</p> <p>The title of the act, and the description of the day, will not warrant the conclusion that the intention of the law is to enforce the Sabbath as a religious institution. The terms \" Christian Sabbath or Sunday,\u201d are used simply to designate the day selected by the Legislature. The same construction would obtain and the same result follow, if any other terms were employed, as \"the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday,\u201d \"the Sabbath day,\u201d or \"the first day of the week,\u201d which are found in similar statutes of other States.</p> <p>That the law operates with inconvenience to some is no argument against its constitutionality. Such inconvenience is an incident to all general laws.</p> <p>The title of an act is never held to control the legislative intent. This intent is to be sought in the purview or body of the act; and when the language in this part is clear and unambiguous, no other part can avail to contradict or control it. The title can be resorted to only in cases of ambiguity, and is then of slight value.</p> <p>Nor is this well-settled rule as to the effect of a title, in any degree changed by the twenty-fifth section of article four of the Constitution, which requires that \" every law enacted by the Legislature shall embrace but one object, and that shall he expressed in the title.\u201d This section is merely directory, and does not nullify laws passed in violation of it.</p> <p>In determining the question of power in the Legislature to pass the act, the Court can not consider whether that power was wisely or unwisely exercised, or from pure or impure motives.</p> <p>The act is not in conflict with the first section of article one of the Constitution, which declares that \"all men are by nature free and independent, and have certain inalienable rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty; acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining safety and happiness.\u201d \u201c</p> <p>The rights enumerated in this section are to be enjoyed in a constitutional government^ in subordination to the general laws of the State. This section was never intended* to inhibit legislation on the rights enumerated.</p> <p>The Legislature possesses the power to legislate for the good order, the peace, welfare, and happiness of society. The means by which these ends are to be effected are left to its discretion, but because the discretion may be abused its acts are not for that reason void. ,</p> <p>It is to he supposed that the members of the Legislature will exercise some wisdom in its acts. If they do not, the remedy is with the people. Frequent elections by the people furnish the only protection against the abuse of acknowledged legislative power.</p> <p>The right to acquire property may be regulated for the public good, though thereby the facility of acquisition is lessened.</p> <p>The judiciary does not possess the right to supervise the exercise of legislative discretion in matters of mere expediency, and the assumption of such right would be usurpation.</p> <p>The \"Act to provide for the better observance of the Sabbath, approved April 10,1858,\u201d is constitutional.</p>"}

Prior to the treaty with Spain of 1819 he files notice of his claim with the Secretary of the United States. The treaty includes all claims thus filed pi'ior to its date. It is signed by both parties and ratified by the United States. Spain refuses to ratify; the time within which it mustberatified expires, and the United States give notice that ilall causes of difference\" between the parties \u201cwill stand inihesame situation as if that convention had never been made.\" The mei'chant then presses his claims directly, and procures their acknowledgment and liquidation from the Spanish government, through the report of a royal junta, in the nature of a decree. This decree covers the contracts and personal injuries and includes intei\u2019cst. It is approved by the King, and by the laws'and customs of Spain is of as high and binding a nature as the judgment of a/mj tribunal. On thetrial before the junta the mei'chant puts in evidence and surrenders all his vouchers and evidences of indebtedness. They are cancelled and filed in the finalice department of Spain. The Cortes determined to provide for the payment of the decree. They areinformedby the Spanish secretary of'state and by the American minister at Madrid that if the treaty of 1819 be ratified, and certainprivate grants in Florida be annulled, the United States will pay the claim of the mei\u2019chant. On the faith of these representations the Cortes annul the private grants, Spain ratifies the treaty, the United States accept the ratification, and acquire thereby the Floridas, free from the private gra/nts. While the final acceptance of the treaty is under consideration, the merchant notifies the President and Senate that if special provision is not made for the full and immediate payment of his claim, heprefei's to remain a creditor of Spain, and objects to the indebted/ness being appropriated by the United States. No such provision is made, and he is sent, with olhei' claimants, before a commission established by the treaty. The commissioners refuse to recognize the Spanish decree, and require him to produce the original vouchers. The government sustains the commissioners and demands the vouchers. Spain refuses to deliver them, and the commission expires. The United States pay to other claimants the $5,000,000 provided for by the treaty. The claim of the merchant is lost by the refusal of the United States to recognize the Spanish decree, and of Spain to furnish the original vouchers. By the convention of 1834 (Q Stat. L., p. 460J> the United States again release Spain from all claims of American citizens.</p> <p>I. The government may take private property for public use by the terms of a treaty, and may release the clioses in action of American citizens to a foreign government.</p> <p>A debt due to an American citizen from a foreign government is as much property as houses and lands, and when taken for public use is to be paid for in the same manner.</p> <p>A release by the United States to a foreign government (in part consideration of a cession of territory) of an indebtedness to an American citizen, acknowledged to be valid, is a taking of private property for public use. But where a special mode for obtaining compensation is designated by statute or by treaty, or where the power of assessing or deciding is lodged in a special tribunal, the remedy designated can alone be pursued, and no action therefor can be maintained in this court.</p> <p>II. The commission established by the treaty with Spain of 1819 (8 Stat. L., p. 252) was a special tribunal, having exclusive jurisdiction of claims arising under the treaty, and no other court can correct its mistakes or revise its decisions.</p> <p>ni. The commission established by the Spanish treaty of 1819 (8 Stat. L., p. 252) had jurisdiction of a claim founded on the award or decree of a Spanish junta, rendered subsequent to the dale of the treaty, even though it embraced interest to the day of its date, where the original claim existed prior to the date of the treaty and was embraced in its terms.</p>"}
