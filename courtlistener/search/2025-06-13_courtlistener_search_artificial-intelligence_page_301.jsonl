Stats., arts. 5099, 5120, 5123; Houston  T.C. Ry. Co. v. County of Presidio,  53 Tex. 518 ; Chisholm v. Adams,  71 Tex. 679 \n[ 71 Tex. 679 ].\n\nAppellant's application for an injunction is premature. It is based upon fears and not facts. \"Courts deal with things as they are and do not determine rights upon mere possibilities.\" Houston T.C. Ry. Co. v. County of Presidio,  53 Tex. 518 ; Chisholm v. Adams,  71 Tex. 681 ; Roudanez v. Mayor of New Orleans, 29 La. Ann., 271; Louisville  N. Ry. Co. v. Bate, 22 Fed. Rep., 480; People v. Canal Board of New York,  55 N.Y. 390 .\n\nThe purpose of the Act is to require the corporations, etc., subject to its provisions, to assess separately their tangible and intangible properties. The Act does not authorize the State Tax Board to assess intangible property or any property, but, on the contrary, expressly requires that this property shall be assessed as all other property is assessed for taxation. It follows, therefore, that the Act is subject to none of the objections taken by appellant and the court properly sustained appellees' general demurrers to the petition. State v. Austin \nN.W. Ry. Co.,  94 Tex. 530 ; City of Dallas v. Dallas Street Ry. Co.,  95 Tex. 276 .\n\nThe Act does not transfer to the State Tax Board any of the powers or duties of the assessor of taxes, nor does it in any manner affect the constitutional rights, powers or duties of the assessor of taxes. Rev. Stats., arts. 5123, 5099; Act February 8, 1881, construed in Stone v. Brown,  54 Tex. 339 ; State v. Farmer,  94 Tex. 235 ; Black on Interpretation of Laws, pp. 93, 98, 56, 73, 60 and 61.\n\nThe Act does not require the State Tax Board to apportion appellants' intangible property among the counties in which it does business on the mileage basis. If the Act does require that the property shall be so apportioned it violates no provision of the Constitution of this\nState or of the United States. Pittsburg, etc., Ry. Co. v. Backus,  154 U.S. 430 , and cases therein cited.\n\nThe Act expressly requires that appellant's intangible property shall be assessed as all other taxable property is assessed, and equalized and taxed as all other property is equalized and taxed, and it therefore violates no provision of the Constitution. The Legislature of the State of Texas has constitutional power to regulate the mode and manner of ascertaining and determining what intangible property, if any, appellant had and possessed on the 1st day of January of this year, for taxation for state and county purposes. Appellant acquired, owns and possesses all of its property subject to the Constitution and laws of this State in relation taxation thereof, and there is no guarantee, constitutional or otherwise, from the State of Texas to the appellant, that its property shall not be ascertained for taxation in such reasonable and lawful manner as the Legislature of the State of Texas may ordain and prescribe. (Const., art. 8.)\n\nThe Constitution and statutes of this State require that all property shall be assessed for taxation at its true and full value in money. It does not appear from appellant's petition that there is any practice in the State of Texas, or in any county of the State of Texas, authorizing the assessment of any property for taxation at other than its true and full value in money. If there does exist in the State of Texas a practice such as is alleged with respect to the assessment of property for taxation in violation of law, that is no justification or excuse for the appellant to likewise violate the law in the assessment of its property for taxation, and the Act is not void even if its design is, and its effect will be to require the appellant to assess its intangible property as required by the Constitution and laws of this State. It does not appear that the intangible property of appellant will be assessed by the tax assessors, or equalized by the County Commissioners' Court, at any higher or different percentage of its value than will be assessed and equalized the property of other persons and corporations. Sec. 24, chap. 154, p. 281, Acts 1876; Rev. Stats., 1879, art. 4692; Rev. Stats., 1895, art. 5088; Engelke v. Schlenker,  75 Tex. 559 \n[ 75 Tex. 559 ]; Albuquerque Bank v. Perea,  147 U.S. 87 .\n\nThe Intangible Assets Act requires appellant's intangible property to be assessed for taxation as other property is assessed, and it prescribes no fixed or arbitrary rules, nor any rule whatever for the valuation of its property for taxation. The power conferred upon the State Tax Board by the Act violates no provision of the Constitution of the United States or of the State of Texas. State R.R. Tax Cases,  92 U.S. 575 ; Pittsburg, etc., Ry. Co. v. Backus,  154 U.S. 421 .\n\nThe Act does not confer or attempt to confer upon the Secretary of State or Comptroller of Public Accounts any powers inconsistent with the Constitution of this State. It does not confer upon either of them any power either legislative or judicial. Arnold v. State,  71 Tex. 239 ; Stone v. Brown, 54 Tex. 330 ; Langenberg v. Decker, 31 N.E. (Ind.), 190; Cleveland, etc., Ry. Co. v. Backus, 18 L.R.A. (Ind.), 729; French v. State, 29 L.R.A. (Ind.), 113.\n\nThe Legislature of the State of Texas has constitutional power to classify property for the purpose of ascertaining its existence and its\nvalue subject to taxation. State R.R. Tax Cases,  92 U.S. 610 ; Kentucky R.R. Tax Cases,  115 U.S. 337 ; Florida Cent., etc., Ry. Co., v. Reynolds,  183 U.S. 471 ; King v. Mullins,  171 U.S. 404 ; Coulter v. Louisville  N. Ry.

The inducements to the ignorant and unwary, that in one sense of the word is, tantamount to an invitation to the\nignorant and unwary, to be tempted by it'\" whereas the presiding Judge should have qualified his charge by stating that the \"seductive instrument or place\" must have been within reach of \"the ignorant and unwary.\"\n\nThat the presiding Judge erred in charging the plaintiff's twelfth request to charge, as follows: \"Children, wherever they go, must be expected to act upon childish instincts and impulses, and others who are chargeable with a duty of care and caution towards them must calculate upon this and take precautions accordingly. If they leave exposed to the observation of children anything which would be tempting to them, and which in their immature judgment might naturally suppose that they were at liberty to handle or play with, they should expect that liberty to be taken. `That is another way of saying, Gentlemen of the Jury, that a man must anticipate that the normal child will do what the normal child is expected to do, and they must act accordingly'\"; the error being that the charge makes one liable for anything \"exposed to the observation of children,\" regardless of whether it is within reach or not.\n\nThat the presiding Judge erred in charging the plaintiff's fourteenth request to charge, as follows: \"One who artificially brings or creates upon his own premises, any dangerous thing which from its nature has a tendency to attract the childish instincts of children to play with it, is bound, as a mere matter of social duty, to take such reasonable precautions as the circumstances admit of, to the end that they may be protected from injury while so playing with it, or coming in its vicinity\"; the error being that the presiding Judge failed to qualify such charge by a proviso that knowledge should be brought home to the owner that the \"dangerous thing\" did attract children, that it was within reach and they did play with it.\n\nThat the presiding Judge erred in charging that part of plaintiff's fifteenth request to charge, as follows: \"Although\nthe dangerous thing may not be what is termed an attractive nuisance &#8212; that is to say, may not have especial attraction for children by reason of their childish instincts &#8212; yet where it is so left exposed that they are likely to come in contact with it, and where their coming in contact with it is obviously dangerous to them, the person so exposing the dangerous thing should reasonably anticipate the injury that is likely to happen to them, from its being so exposed, and is bound to take reasonable pains to guard it, so as to prevent injury to them\"; it being submitted that the said charge should have been qualified by stating that the owner must have known that children were likely to come into contact with the \"dangerous thing\" and that it must have been placed within their reach.\n\nThat the presiding Judge erred in charging the plaintiff's sixteenth request to charge, as follows: \"It can scarcely be questioned at this time that in this State, at least, when one maintains upon his premises a dangerous instrumentality, which tends to attract the youthful instincts of children to use it for their amusement, a new duty is imposed upon the one maintaining such instrumentality, to wit: the duty of exercising ordinary care to prevent injury to them by coming in contact with it. In other words, he is required reasonably to anticipate the injuries that are likely to happen to them\"; the error being in failing to qualify such charge by stating that it should have been brought home to the owner that the instrumentality did attract children to use it for amusement &#8212; that the owner knew of such use and that he had placed the instrumentality within reach of children.", "procedural_history": "", "scdb_id": "", "sibling_ids": [3877211, 3877212], "source": "ZU", "status": "Published", "suitNature": "", "syllabus": ""}
