Held, that the complaint alleges a cause of action in a suit seeking to exercise the power of eminent domain over land for the improvement of a river for storing water for floating sawlogs and other timber products.</p> <p>2. Under the provisions of section 14, article 1, of the constitution, the necessary nse of lands for the complete development of the material resources of the state is declared to be a public use.</p> <p>3. Under the provisions of subdivision 3, section 5210, Revised Statutes, the necessary use of lands for storage basins and the improvement of the floatability of such streams may be obtained by the exercise of the power of eminent domain, and the provisions of said subdivision apply to all streams not navigable in fact.</p> <p>4. The phrase \"streams not navigable,\u201d as used in said section 5210, Revised Statutes, means streams not navigable in fact.</p> <p>5. The legislature cannot by legislative act impress the character of navigability on a stream that is not navigable, as a stream not navigable in fact cannot be made so by legislation.</p> <p>6. The power of eminent domain is an incident of sovereignty inherent in the states of this Union by.virtue of their sovereignty.</p> <p>7. The provisions of section 14, article 1 of the constitution of Idaho, declare for what purposes the power of eminent domain may be exercised, and the legislature cannot prohibit the exercise of that power for any of the purposes therein specified.</p> <p>8. The right to exercise the power of eminent domain under the constitution of this state is not made to depend upon the narrow and restricted meaning of the phrase \"public use\u201d as defined by courts of last resort of some of the states.</p> <p>9. Under the provisions of said section of the constitution, the general welfare and benefit of the public is taken into consideration, and if the taking is necessary to the complete development of the material resources of the state, sueh taking is for a public use.</p> <p>10. The term \"public use,\u201d as used in said section 14, article 1, of the constitution, means public usefulness and productive of general benefit. That term is a flexible one, and necessarily has been of constant growth as new public uses have developed.</p> <p>11. The power of eminent domain under our constitution and laws is given a degree of elasticity, thus making it capable of meeting new conditions and improvements of the ever-increasing necessities of society.</p> <p>12. The person or corporation who exercises the power of eminent domain assumes certain obligations to the public, and the grant of that right carries with it the. right of public supervision and reasonable control.</p> <p>13. One who exercises the right of eminent domain in the improvement of non-navigable rivers in this state for the purpose of floating logs and timber products does not thereby seeure the exclusive use and control of such streams, but sueh streams are open to the use of anyone who may have occasion to use them for any purpose.</p> <p>14. Under the provisions of section 835, Kevised Statutes, the construction of any dam or boom on any creek or river in this state that will unreasonably delay or hinder the passage or floating of timber down the same is prohibited.</p> <p>15. In the enactment of section 5210, the legislative intent was to make the provisions thereof applicable to all streams not navigable in fact.</p> <p>16. Under the provisions of said section of the constitution tho power of eminent domain may be exercised when necessary to the complete development of the material resources of the state, and the great lumbering interest of the state is one of the material resources of the state, and cannot be completely developed without the exercise of said power.</p> <p>17. While said provisions of the constitution are not self-executing, or, in other words, do not furnish the procedure by which that power may be exercised, the procedure to subject lands to a public use has been provided by the legislature.</p> <p>(Syllabus by the court.)</p>"}
