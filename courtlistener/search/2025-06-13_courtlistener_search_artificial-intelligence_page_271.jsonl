{"absolute_url": "/opinion/3556186/bricker-v-city-of-troy/", "attorney": "Frank Howell, Berryman Henwood, Rendlen  White  and  Creech   Penn  for appellants.\n\n(1) Instruction 3 did not require the jury to find the facts alleged in the petition. It did not require the jury to find that the deceased took hold of the wire with his hand without any notice or knowledge on his part that said wire was charged with a high voltage of electricity sufficient to kill or injure him. It thereby narrowed the issues made by the pleadings. The issues made by the pleadings must not be broadened or narrowed by the instructions. (a) As to the necessity of avoiding contributory negligence by the petition sec: 29 Cyc. 575, 576; Bassett v. Tel. Co.,  48 Mo. App. 568 . (b) As to instructing on the allegations of the petition, see: Karte v. Mfg. Co., 247 S.W. 417; Compton v. Railroad,  147 Mo. App. 414 ; State ex rel. v. Ellison, 270 Mo. 645 ; Degonia v. Railroad,  224 Mo. 564 ; Scrivner v. Railroad, 260 Mo. 421 ; Riley v. City of Independence,  258 Mo. 671 ; Walquist v. Railway,  292 Mo. 34 ; Kuhlman v. Water Co., 271 S.W. 797. (2) The allegations of the petition or the evidence adduced did not authorize the giving of Instruction 7: (a) There was no evidence in the case tending to show that decedent took hold of the wire at a time of sudden and imminent peril to himself or members of his family without time to reflect or deliberate; and without such evidence on which to predicate such instruction it had no place in the case. (b) The petition does not plead that decedent took hold of the wire at a time of impending danger to himself or members of his family without time to reflect or deliberate, so that this instruction submitted an issue to the jury not raised by the pleadings, and thereby broadened the issues formed by the pleading, and is universally condemned as error, by this, and all our appellate courts. See cases above. (c) The rules of law which permit a recovery by one who acts to his hurt on apparent imminent peril are, as classified by this court: (1) the peril must have been caused\nby the negligence of the one against whom indemnity is sought; (2) the apprehension of peril from the standpoint of the injured person must have been reasonable, and (3) the appearance of danger must have been imminent, leaving no time for deliberation. The facts in evidence do not bring decedent within the above classification. Kleiber v. Railway,  107 Mo. 240 ; Stanley v. Helen,  204 Mo. App. 159 ; Delfasse v. Railways, 201 S.W. 860; Ephland v. Railway,  137 Mo. 187 ; Moore v. Railways, 189 Mo. App. 555 ; Agnew v. Railways,  178 Mo. 119 . (d) In any event, it was error to give this instruction separately, for the essentials to liability are the essential elements of plaintiff's case, and ought to be embraced within the main instruction which directs a verdict. These elements are lacking in Instruction 3, which directs a verdict. Delfasse v. Railways, 201 S.W. 860. (e) The evidence reveals that the deceased voluntarily took hold of the wire, knowing it was charged with a high voltage of electricity, when he could have avoided the injury by taking his family out of the house. 29 Cyc. 502; Smith v. Mills,  238 S.W. 573 ; Myers v. Railway,  103 Mo. App. 268 ; Moore v. Railroad,  146 Mo. 572 ; Smith v. Box Co.,  193 Mo. 715 ; Woodson v. Railway,  224 Mo. 685 ; Smotherman v. Railroad,  29 Mo. App. 265 ; Fusselman v. Railroad, 139 Mo. App. 198 ; Wheeler v. Wall,  157 Mo. App. 38 ; Nivert v. Railway,  232 Mo. 591 ; Collett v. Kuhlman,  243 Mo. 643 ; Carroll v. Transit Co.,  107 Mo. 653 ; Gabriel v. Railroad,  135 Mo. App. 222 . (f) There was no evidence that deceased's family was in actual danger at the time he took hold of the wire, and there was no evidence that the negligence after deceased started to the rescue was different from that toward his family. No such hypothetical facts were embodied in the instruction, and the instruction was, therefore erroneous and prejudicial to defendant. Donahue v. Railway,  83 Mo. 560 ; Eversole v. Railway,  249 Mo. 52 . (g) There was no emergency or sudden peril in the case to excuse the contributory negligence of deceased. The continued ringing of the telephone bell and sparks and flame coming from the telephone box had been warning deceased for quite a while of the danger, prior to the time he took hold of the wire. Hall v. Railway, 240 S.W. 175. (3) The defendant's demurrer to the evidence should have been sustained, for there were two or more possible causes for a high voltage of electrical current to be on the wire that killed Finten Bricker, and the jury should not have been permitted to conjecture or guess as to the cause. Byerly v. Light  Power Co., 130 Mo. App. 603 ; Robers v. Packing Co.,  180 Mo. App. 227 ; Weber v. Milling Co., 242 S.W. 985; Purcell v. Tennent Shoe Co., 187 Mo. 276 ; Rogers v. Packing Co.,  167 Mo. App. 58 ; Goransson v. Mfg. Co.,  186 Mo. 300 ; Epperson v. Tel. Co.,  155 Mo. 382 ; Dyer v. Contr. Co., 258 S.W. 48. (4) As a further reason why the case should not have been submitted to the jury, and the\ncourt erred in submitting the case to the jury, is that, the evidence in the case is wholly insufficient to sustain the verdict, for the reason, that Bricker's death was not shown to have been caused by the negligence of defendant by any positive or direct testimony, but had to be established by inference piled on inference alone, and it is not permissible that a presumption may be based on a presumption, nor an inference upon an inference to support a verdict. Wright v. Ins. Co.,  188 Mo. App. 457 ; Hamilton v. Ry. Co.,  250 Mo. 715 ; Swearinger v. Ry. Co., 221 Mo. 644 ; Yarnell v. Ry. Co.,  113 Mo. 579 ; Glick v. Ry. Co., 57 Mo. App. 97 ; State v. Lackland,  136 Mo. 26 ; State ex rel. v. Cox, 298 Mo. 427 ; Swartz v. Frank,  183 Mo. 438 ; Hays v. Hogan,  273 Mo. 1 . (5) A still further reason why the defendant's demurrer should have been sustained, is that, the plaintiff's deceased husband was so plainly guilty of negligence contributing directly to his death that it precludes her recovery in this action. Shuck v. Realty Co., 201 S.W. 559; Smith v. Box Co.,  193 Mo. 715 ; Doerr v. Brewing Assn.,  176 Mo. 547 ; George v. Mfg. Co.,  159 Mo. 333 ; Nugent v. Milling Co.,  131 Mo. 241 .\n\n Eby  Hulse, D.E. Killam  and  Emil P. Rosenberger  for respondent.\n\n(1) The plaintiff was not required to prove the defendant's negligence or that such negligence was the proximate cause of the death of her husband by direct evidence. She was entitled to prove the primary fact of negligence and proximate cause of death by circumstantial evidence alone. Settle v. Railroad Co., 127 Mo. 336 ; Cambron v. Ry. Co.,  165 Mo. 543 ; Longree v. Mfg. Co., 120 Mo. App. 478 . (2) It was negligence  per se  to operate the light plant and run it, after it had been shut down, for ten, fifteen or twenty minutes to let the people out of the picture show when both the engineer and the manager and superintendent of the plant knew there was trouble on the lines. Harrison v. Electric Light Co.,  195 Mo. 606 ; Kidd v. Light  Power Co., 239 S.W. 586. (3) Plaintiff made out a case to go to the jury. The use of electricity for commercial purposes involves the exercise of the utmost care to protect others rightfully within the sphere of its deadly action from injury thereby. Campbell v. United Rys. Co., 243 Mo. 141 ; Hickman v. Electric Light  Power Co., 226 S.W. 573. (4) Plaintiff need neither plead nor prove that he was without fault, for contributory negligence is an affirmative defense, and an instruction for plaintiff designed to cover the whole case is not defective nor erroneous if it does not include the defense of contributory negligence. Petty v. Railroad,  88 Mo. 306 ; Hudson v. Ry. Co.,  101 Mo. 29 ; Young v. Iron Co.,  103 Mo. 324 ; Meily v. Railroad,  215 Mo. 567 ; Karte v. Mfg. Co., 247 S.W. 417. (5) Decedent's\nhusband was not guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. Whether he was guilty of contributory negligence was a question for the jury. When suddenly confronted with an unexpected and appalling danger persons do not usually, and the law does not require them, to act instantly and in the most intelligent way to avert or extricate themselves from peril. Temple Electric Co. v. Halliburton,  136 S.W. 584 ; Caglione v. Electric Light Co.,  67 N.Y.S. 660 ; Leavenworth Coal Co. v. Ratchford, 48 P. 927; Walters v. Electric Light Co., 54 P. 960; Whiteworth v. Belt Ry. Co., 36 So. 414; Dillon v. Light Co., 36 A. 164; Walters v. Power Co., 84 S.E. 617. (6) Instruction 7 on imminent danger correctly stated the law as applicable to the facts. Kleiber v. Ry. Co.,  107 Mo. 240 ; Bishop v. Ry. Co., 121 Mo. 216 ; Sweigert v. Lusk,  196 Mo. App. 480 ; Strack v. Gen. Baking Co., 223 S.W. 94. (7) Instruction 7 is free from defendant's criticism. It did not tell the jury that if they found certain facts to be true then they should find decedent Bricker not guilty of contributory negligence; it merely told the jury that they might take into consideration certain facts in passing upon the question of his contributory negligence. Lange v. Mo. Pac. Ry. Co.,  208 Mo. 458 . (8) If instructions taken as a whole present the issues fairly and are not misleading and are not calculated to mislead the jury that is all that is necessary. Henry v.

{"absolute_url": "/opinion/4235558/anselmi-v-city-of-rock-springs/", "attorney": "For the plaintiffs and appellants, the cause was submitted on the brief of  Glen G. Stanton  of Rock Springs.\n\nThis action involves the validity of a bond issue by the City of Rock Springs, Wyoming. The question was decided by the lower court on a demurrer filed by defendants and sustained by the court. Plaintiffs elected to stand upon their pleading and judgment was rendered for defendants against plaintiffs. Section 22-1601, R.S. 1931, 5th sub-division, does not authorize the issuance of the bonds, for the reason that it confers no specific authority for such an issue. Only sanitary sewers are intended by said section. We grant that a conflict of authority exists on this question. State Board of Health v. City (N.J.)  35 A. 835 ; Aldrich v. Paine (Iowa)  76 N.W. 812 ; Mound City Company v. Miller, 70 S.W. 721; Blaisdell v. Stoneham,  118 N.E. 919 . It is the contention of plaintiffs that it would be necessary for Section 22-1601, R.S. to read \"System of sewerage and drainage\" in order to authorize issuance of bonds for the proposed improvements. The notice given to electors was misleading and void, in that it lead voters to believe that the bonds in question when computed with outstanding bonds did not exceed 2% of assessed valuation, when as a matter of fact outstanding bonds already exceeded 4% of the assessed valuation.\n\nFor the defendants and respondents, the cause was submitted on the brief of  Edwin V. Magagna  of Rock Springs, Wyoming.\n\nThe only limitation upon bonded indebtedness of the character here involved is found at Article 16, Section 5 of the State Constitution. The statutory limitation appears at Section 22-1603, R.S. 1931. The record discloses that the proposed bond issue would not exceed any constitutional or statutory limitation, provided they come under the correct classification. In considering the effect of Section 22-1601, R.S. we quote the language of Section 22-1605, R.S. Defendants contend\nthat the term \"System of Sewerage\" used in this section, includes all types of sewers. Section 22-1603, R.S. uses the term \"For the purpose of building and construction of sewerage systems.\" We also direct attention to Article 3, Chapter 22, R.S., relating to cities of the first class. See also Words and Phrases, First Series, p. 6458 and Second Series, p. 555; 57 C.J. 539; Pioneer Company v. Portland,  247 P. 319 . Drainage laws are closely akin to sewer laws. Mound City Co. v. Miller (Mo.)  70 S.W. 721 ; Black's Law Dictionary defining \"Sewer.\" As to the bond proposition being properly submitted to a vote of the people, reference should first be made to Section 22-1605, R.S., and we submit that the record shows full compliance therewith and also with Sections 36-402, 403 and 405, R.S. 1931.
