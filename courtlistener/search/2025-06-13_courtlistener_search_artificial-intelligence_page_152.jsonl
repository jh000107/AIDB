The trial judge alluded only to appropriate sources of evidence, in no way suggested how such evidence should be considered by the jurors, and did not convey any personal opinion which he may have had concerning the juror's sources of influence. The trial judge was simply clarifying an ambiguous admission by a prospective juror; it is mere speculation that the other prospective jurors were discouraged from disclosing any possible influence outside the evidence admitted at trial due to the trial judge's remarks.\n\n<bold>Am Jur 2d, Trial \u00a7\u00a7 276, 277, 280</bold>.\n\n<bold>5.

I don't see how that's relevant, but step down and show them your wrists.\" Whether the witness had scars on her wrists was not a question of fact for the jury to decide and the trial court's comment was not directed at the relevance of her alleged suicide attempts as mitigating evidence, but more likely at the relevance of the witness having to show the jury the scars on her wrists as evidence of her suicide attempts. Furthermore, the trial court submitted and the jury<page_number>Page 447</page_number>\nfound as a mitigating circumstance that defendant witnessed physical and verbal abuse of his mother, her abuse of drugs and alcohol, and an attempted suicide; thus it is obvious that the trial court did not persuade the jury that the suicide attempts were irrelevant at the sentencing phase.\n\n<bold>Am Jur 2d, Trial \u00a7 280</bold>.\n\n<bold>6.

Those that were supported by the evidence were submitted to the jury in substance and those that were not supported by the evidence were not submitted to the jury. Viewed contextually, the substance of the mitigating circumstances that defendant requested were subsumed into other submitted mitigating circumstances, including the catchall mitigating circumstance, and the jury was not precluded from considering any of defendant's mitigating evidence.\n\n<bold>Am Jur 2d, Criminal Law \u00a7\u00a7 598, 599</bold>.\n\n<block_quote> <bold>Propriety, in imposing sentence for original offense</bold> <bold>after revocation of probation, of considering acts because</bold> <bold>of which probation was revoked. 65 ALR3d 1100</bold>.</block_quote>\n<block_quote> <bold>What constitutes playing \"mitigating role\" in offense</bold> <bold>allowing decrease in offense level under United States</bold> <bold>Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 <cross_reference>3B1.2</cross_reference>, 18 USCS Appendix. 100 ALR</bold> <bold>Fed. 156</bold>.</block_quote>\n<bold>7.

The prosecutor's questions were never answered; moreover, our system is based upon the assumption that trial jurors are women and men of character and sufficient intelligence to fully understand and comply with proper instructions of the court not to consider certain evidence and they are presumed to have done so.\n\n<bold>Am Jur 2d, Trial \u00a7 1120</bold>.\n\n<bold>8.  Robbery \u00a7 138 (NCI4th) \u2014 capital murder and armed</bold> <bold>robbery \u2014 charge on larceny denied \u2014 no error</bold>\nThe trial court did not err in a prosecution for first-degree murder and robbery with a firearm by failing to submit the lesser included offense of larceny where the State introduced substantial evidence of defendant's guilt of robbery with a firearm and there is no evidence to support defendant's contention that he formed the intent to take the victim's property at a time which could not be part of a continuous transaction.\n\n<bold>Am Jur 2d, Robbery \u00a7 75</bold>.\n\n<bold>9.

The instruction clearly comported with defendant's evidence, and the court also instructed the jury that it was enough that defendant's mind or emotions were disturbed from any cause and that he was under the influence of the disturbance when he killed the victim. The instruction did not preclude the jury from considering mitigating evidence.\n\n<bold>Am Jur 2d, Criminal Law \u00a7 599</bold>.\n\n<block_quote> <bold>Modern status of test of criminal responsibility \u2014 state</bold> <bold>cases. 9 ALR4th 526</bold>.</block_quote><page_number>Page 449</page_number>\n<block_quote> <bold>What constitutes playing \"mitigating role\" in offense</bold> <bold>allowing decrease in offense level under United States</bold> <bold>Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 <cross_reference>3B1.2</cross_reference>, 18 USCS Appendix.</bold> <bold>100 ALR Fed. 156</bold>.</block_quote>\n<bold>10.

Although defendant contended that there was no evidence that the victim was more vulnerable to the commission of the offense by reason of his age, the victim was somewhere between seventy-two and seventy-seven years old at the time of the murder; he suffered from emphysema and relied on inhalers at all times; he had limited use of one arm and weighed only ninety-three pounds at the time of the autopsy; and the victim had provided defendant with shelter, food, cigarettes, beer, and transportation when defendant had nowhere else to go. The victim's age, physical disabilities, and stature made him vulnerable and an inviting target for the physically superior twenty-eight-year-old defendant;.

The evidence tended to show that the victim, an elderly man with poor health, had befriended the twenty-eight-year old defendant, taken him into his home, and offered him respect and goodwill; defendant took the victim's belongings and attained money by using his personal checks throughout several days following the murder while leaving the victim's body in the recliner in which he was murdered; and the victim was killed in the solace of his own home.<page_number>Page 450</page_number>\n<bold>Am Jur 2d, Criminal Law \u00a7 628</bold>.\n\n<block_quote> <bold>Sufficiency of evidence, for purposes of death penalty,</bold> <bold>to establish statutory aggravating circumstance that murder</bold> <bold>was heinous, cruel, depraved, or the like \u2014 post-</bold><bold><italic>Gregg</italic></bold> <bold>cases. 63 ALR4th 478</bold>.</block_quote>\n<block_quote> <bold>Sufficiency of evidence, for purposes of death penalty,</bold> <bold>to establish statutory aggravating circumstance that murder</bold> <bold>was committed for pecuniary gain, as consideration or</bold> <bold>in expectation of receiving something of monetary value,</bold> <bold>and the like \u2014 post-</bold><bold><italic>Gregg</italic></bold> <bold>cases. 66 ALR4th 417</bold>.</block_quote>\n"}
