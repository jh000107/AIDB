The Foreign Defendants also move to dismiss the claims against them for lack of personal jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(2). For the reasons that follow, the motion to dismiss is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. The motion is DENIED with regard to Plaintiff FrontPoint's Sherman Act claims and unjust enrichment claim against Defendant UBS; the motion is otherwise GRANTED., This case is one of several civil cases filed in this District alleging that certain banks manipulated and fixed prices of the *530London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"), submitted them to the British Bankers' Association (\"BBA\"), and thereby made artificial submissions over a period of years, which allegedly harmed Plaintiffs as purchasers or sellers of financial instruments they claim were in some way connected to LIBOR. LIBOR is an interest rate benchmark used in financial markets around the world and intended to reflect the competitive conditions of the London interbank money market. (CAC \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.) LIBOR is calculated by averaging a number of submitting banks' estimates of their own respective costs of borrowing money in the London interbank market in several currencies and for a number of maturities (or \"tenors\") per currency. (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 116-17.) It is administered by the BBA, \"the leading trade association for the United Kingdom banking and financial services sector.\" (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 91, 92.) It is published daily and used to price, benchmark, and/or settle interest rate derivatives traded over-the-counter and on public exchanges, including interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements, foreign exchange forwards, and futures contracts. (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 8, 121.), During the relevant time period, the BBA published LIBOR rates for ten different currencies,2 including the British Pound Sterling, based upon interest rate quotas that panel banks submit. (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 103-07.) Defendants in this case were BBA panel banks that controlled the British Pound Sterling LIBOR (\"Sterling LIBOR\") during the class period. (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 101, 109, 116.) Other actions filed in this District involve the U.S. Dollar,3 Japanese Yen,4 and Swiss Franc5 LIBOR. The financial instruments used by Plaintiffs in this action were foreign exchange (\"FX\") forward contracts, interest rate swaps, and FX futures contracts traded on the Chicago *531Mercantile Exchange (\"CME\"). (See id. \u00b6\u00b6 37-39.), To set Sterling LIBOR, the BBA asks the panel banks to answer independently the following question on every banking day in London: \"At what rate could you borrow [Sterling], were you to do so by asking for and then accepting inter-bank offers in a reasonable market size, just prior to 11:00 a.m.?\" (Id. \u00b6 101.) The panel members each submit answers reflecting the rate of interest offered on loans for 15 different maturities, or tenors. (Id. \u00b6 116.) Pursuant to BBA guidelines, each panel bank's answer at each tenor is supposed to reflect actual competitive market rates. (Id. \u00b6 109.) Each panel bank submits its rates electronically to Thomson Reuters, \"as administrator of the LIBOR fixing,\" including the Sterling LIBOR. (Id. \u00b6 117.) After all the submissions are received, the quotes in each tenor are ranked. (See id.) The Sterling LIBOR is then calculated for each tenor by averaging the middle 50% of submissions. (Id.) Because there were sixteen members of the Sterling LIBOR contributing panel, this meant that Thomson Reuters used the middle eight submissions, after discarding the top and bottom quartiles. (Id. \u00b6 101.) \"This average rate becomes the daily official Sterling LIBOR for that particular tenor and is distributed electronically to the market, including within the United States, through Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg among other financial services platforms.\" (Id. \u00b6 117.) Thomson Reuters also publishes each member bank's submissions, including those that were in the top and bottom quartiles. (Id. \u00b6 101.), Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Lloyds, Rabobank, RBS, and UBS were among the members of the sixteen-bank Contributor Panel for Sterling LIBOR during the putative Class Period.6 (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 11, 118.) Plaintiffs allege that each member bank over that period \"coordinated their Sterling LIBOR submissions and manipulative trading practices to fix the prices of Sterling LIBOR-based derivatives for their financial benefit.\" (Id. \u00b6 125.) According to the CAC, \"Defendants' derivatives traders frequently *532used electronic communications, including instant messages and chat rooms, to share information regarding their Sterling LIBOR-based derivatives positions and to request Sterling LIBOR submissions that would manipulate and fix the prices of those derivatives at artificial levels for their financial benefit.\" (Id. \u00b6 126.) Those communications allegedly took place internally as well as \"externally (among Sterling LIBOR-based derivatives traders and submitters located at different, supposedly competing, Sterling LIBOR contributor banks).\" (Id. \u00b6 127.) \"During the Class Period, Defendants entered into a series of agreements designed to create profit or limit liabilities amongst themselves by coordinating the manipulation of Sterling LIBOR and the prices of Sterling LIBOR-based derivatives, by conspiring to, inter alia , make false submissions to the BBA designed to artificially suppress, inflate, maintain, or otherwise alter Sterling LIBOR.\" (Id. \u00b6 238.) Defendants have entered into various settlements and non-prosecution agreements with government regulators, such as the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\"), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\"CFTC\"), and United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\"), in connection with LIBOR manipulation related to various currencies. (See id. \u00b6\u00b6 13-25.)7, Plaintiff Sonterra is an investment fund that traded in Sterling foreign exchange forwards (\"Sterling FX Forwards\") on unspecified dates. (Id. \u00b6 37.) An FX forward is \"[a] transaction that solely involves the exchange of two different currencies on a specific future date at a fixed rate agreed upon on the inception of the contract covering the exchange.\" (Id. \u00b6 121(e).) Sonterra characterizes its forwards as \"Sterling LIBOR-based derivatives,\" (id. \u00b6 37), because the \"cost of buying or selling Sterling under a foreign exchange forward is determined using a formula that incorporates Sterling LIBOR,\" (id. \u00b6 206). \"The calculation involves taking the 'spot price' of Sterling for immediate delivery, and adjusting it to account for the 'cost of carry,' i.e. , the amount of interest paid or received on Sterling deposits, for the duration of the agreement. Sterling LIBOR, the benchmark rate for Sterling deposits, is used in this formula to calculate the cost of carrying Sterling over the duration of the foreign exchange forward.\" (Id. ), Plaintiff FrontPoint is a Delaware limited partnership with its principal place of business in Greenwich, Connecticut. (Id. \u00b6 38.) FrontPoint claims to have entered into \"Sterling LIBOR-based swaps\" with UBS on three occasions in 2007-October *53317, 2007, November 22, 2007, and November 29, 2007-with payments ceasing on those swaps in 2008. (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 209, 211.) These swaps were entered into in accordance with an International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (\"ISDA\") Master Agreement dated May 1, 2007.8 (Id. \u00b6 29.) \"A swap is an over-the-counter Sterling LIBOR-based derivative in which two parties exchange the obligation to make [a] series of payments based on some underlying principal amount for a set period of time.\" (Id. \u00b6 208.) FrontPoint only transacted business with Defendant UBS. (See id. \u00b6 211.), On February 16, 2016, I granted Plaintiffs' motion to consolidate the Sonterra action, Sonterra Capital Master Fund, Ltd. v. Barclays Bank PLC, Case No. 15-cv-3538, with a similar case brought by Plaintiffs FrontPoint and Dennis, FrontPoint European Fund, L.P. v. Barclays Bank plc , No. 16-cv-464, and dismissed Defendants' motion to dismiss with leave to renew after the filing of a consolidated amended complaint. (Doc. 91.) Plaintiffs filed the CAC on February 25, 2016. (Doc. 95.) The CAC asserted federal claims under Section 1 of the Sherman Act (First and Second Claims for Relief), the CEA (Third, Fourth, and Fifth Claims for Relief), RICO (Sixth and Seventh Claims for Relief), as well as state law claims for unjust enrichment and violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (Eighth and Ninth Claims for Relief)., To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), \"a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' \" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) ). A claim will have \"facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" Id. This standard demands \"more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.\" Id. \"Plausibility ... depends on a host of considerations: the full factual picture presented by the complaint, the particular cause of action and its elements, and the existence of alternative explanations so obvious that they render plaintiff's inferences unreasonable.\" L-7 Designs, Inc. v. Old Navy, LLC, 647 F.3d 419, 430 (2d Cir. 2011)., When a defendant moves for dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2), the plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that the court has jurisdiction over the defendant. Kernan v. Kurz-Hastings, Inc. , 175 F.3d 236, 240 (2d Cir. 1999). On a motion under Rule 12(b)(2), when the issue of personal jurisdiction \"is decided initially on the pleadings and without discovery, the plaintiff need show only a prima facie case.\" Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Beech Aircraft Corp. , 751 F.2d 117, 120 (2d Cir. 1984). A plaintiff \"can make this showing through [her] own affidavits and supporting materials[ ] containing an averment of facts that, if credited ... would suffice to establish jurisdiction over the defendant.\" Whitaker v. Am. Telecasting Inc. , 261 F.3d 196, 208 (2d Cir. 2001) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Thus, a court may consider materials outside the pleadings when deciding a motion dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Hsin Ten Enter. USA, Inc. v. Clark Enters. , 138 F.Supp.2d 449, 452 (S.D.N.Y. 2000)., Nat'l Org. for Marriage, Inc. v. Walsh , 714 F.3d 682, 688 (2d Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted)., Defendants move to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and the Foreign Defendants also move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Although personal jurisdiction is a threshold inquiry, and ordinarily addressed prior to the merits of substantive claims, \"that practice is prudential and does not reflect a restriction on the power of the courts to address legal issues.\" ONY, Inc. v. Cornerstone Therapeutics, Inc. , 720 F.3d 490, 498 n.6 (2d Cir. 2013). Because only the Foreign Defendants move for lack of personal jurisdiction, and since the jurisdictional question relies in part on the underlying claims and plausible scope of the conspiracy, see LIBOR VI, 2016 WL 7378980, at *3, I will address the personal jurisdiction questions last, see Sullivan , 2017 WL 685570, at *11 (addressing defendants' 12(b)(6) motion before personal jurisdiction because personal jurisdiction arguments turned in part on substance of 12(b)(6) motion)., The statute of limitations for antitrust claims is four years from the date of accrual. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15b. The limitations period begins to run \"as soon as there is injury to competition.\" Johnson v. Nyack Hosp. , 86 F.3d 8, 11 (2d Cir. 1996).", "caseName": "Sonterra Capital Master Fund v.
