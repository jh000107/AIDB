Pursuant further to statute ((Rev. to 2019) \u00a7 53a-193 (14)), ''sexually explicit conduct'' means ''actual or simulated (A) sexual intercourse . . . (B) besti- ality, (C) masturbation, (D) sadistic or masochistic abuse, or (E) lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person.'' The defendant appealed from his conviction of possession of child pornogra- phy in the first degree. The defendant claimed, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction because the state was required to prove under the applicable statute ((Rev. to 2019) \u00a7 53a-196d (a) (1)) that he had possessed fifty or more images of child pornography and thirteen of the fifty-seven images in evidence depicted child nudity that constituted protected expression under the first amendment to the United States consti- tution rather than sexually explicit conduct, as defined by \u00a7 53a-193 (14). The defendant also claimed, inter alia, that the trial court had improperly instructed the jury that it could consider the six factors articulated in United States v. Dost (636 F. Supp. 828) in determining whether the images in evidence depicted a lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area for purposes of \u00a7 53a-193 (14) (E). Held: The evidence was sufficient to support the defendant's conviction of pos- sessing fifty or more visual depictions of child pornography, this court having determined that at least eleven of the thirteen challenged images depicted a lascivious exhibition of a child's or children's genitals or pubic areas and, thus, constituted child pornography under \u00a7 53a-193 (13) and (14), and, accordingly, the state met its burden of proving that the defendant had possessed a total of fifty-five images of child pornography. This court determined that the first five Dost factors\u2014whether the focal point of the visual depiction is on the child's genitalia or pubic area; whether the setting of the visual depiction is sexually suggestive; whether the child is depicted in an unnatural pose or in inappropriate attire, considering the age of the child; whether the child is fully or partially clothed, or nude; and The listing of judges reflects their seniority status on this court as of the date of oral argument. whether the visual depiction suggests sexual coyness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity\u2014are helpful in assessing whether a depiction is a lascivious exhibition, but they should not be used to define the term ''lascivious exhibition'' and are simply nonexhaustive considerations that may help in assessing whether a depiction is a lascivious exhibition. This court also determined that the sixth Dost factor, whether the visual depiction is intended or designed to elicit a sexual response in the viewer, should not be considered for the purpose of determining whether an image constitutes child pornography under this state's child pornography statutes, as Connecticut law does not make possession of child pornography turn on the subjective reaction of a particular viewer. The trial court's instruction to the jury that it could consider the Dost factors, including the sixth factor, in determining whether an image depicted a lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area was not improper, this court having determined that it was not reasonably probable that this instruc- tion misled the jury when the court did not expressly instruct the jury to focus on the subjective response of the viewer and instructed the jury that it was not obligated to consider any of the Dost factors. The trial court did not err in declining the defense's request for a specific unanimity instruction directing the jurors that they had to be unanimous as to which fifty images constituted child pornography and into which of the five categories of sexually explicit conduct set forth in \u00a7 53a-193 (14) each of those images fell. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting into evidence certain exhibits that showed the file names of two images that had been deleted from the defendant's cell phone and that were associated with the defen- dant's email address, as those exhibits were probative of the issue of whether the defendant had knowledge that he possessed child pornography on his phone, the defendant failed to demonstrate unfair prejudicial impact to counter the substantial probative value of the exhibits, and the trial court took measures to mitigate any potential undue prejudice.
