Lane of Norwich, deceased, brought to and reserved by the Superior Court in New London County,  Brown, J. , upon the allegations of the complaint, admitted in the answers, for the advice of this court.  Superior Court advised that the executors  take the residue absolutely, free from any trust. \n\nLouisa G. Lane, a resident of Norwich, died there August 7th, 1922, aged eighty-three years, leaving a will which was proved in the Court of Probate for the district of Norwich. In the will she created a trust in the sum of $25,000, providing for payment of the net income of the fund to Maria Louisa Lane for life, and the division of the principal fund upon her death among three grandchildren of the deceased husband of the testatrix. She also gave pecuniary legacies of $3,000 each to said grandchildren. The testatrix also made bequests of $1,000 each to eight persons, seven of whom were her nephews and nieces, and these seven persons, together with Lawrence Gilman and Joseph Gilman, grandnephews, and sons of a deceased nephew Arthur C. Gilman, are the defendants in this action.\n\nThe will further provides as follows: \"Sixth. I leave\nmy clothing, laces and jewelry to my niece, Caroline T. Gilman, to be distributed by her among my friends. Seventh. All the rest, residue and remainder of my property both real and personal, of which I may die possessed or to which I may be entitled at my decease, I give, devise and bequeath to my brother, William C. Gilman, for use during his natural life. All the rest residue and remainder of my property, I give, devise and bequeath to my executors to be distributed at their discretion. Eighth. I nominate and appoint my brother, William C. Gilman, my niece, Caroline T. Gilman, and my nephews George H. Gilman and Francis Gilman, or whichever shall qualify and the survivors of them as and for the executors of this my last Will and Testament, and I direct and request that they be required to give only nominal bonds. Ninth. I give to my said executors or executor, and the survivors or survivor of them, the power to sell either at public or private sale, or to lease at their discretion, any portion of my property, real or personal of which I may die possessed.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs, Caroline T. Gilman, George H. Gilman, and Francis Gilman, appointed as executors in the will, have duly qualified as such executors and are now acting. William C. Gilman, the fourth executor named in said will, predeceased the testatrix. The plaintiffs are also defendants in their individual capacity.\n\nThe testatrix was the widow of George W. Lane, to whom she was married on or about May 30th, 1883, and who died on or about December 30th, 1883. No children were ever born to Louisa G. Lane. She had six brothers and sisters of the whole blood, all of whom predeceased her: Edward W. Gilman, Elizabeth G. Thompson, Daniel C. Gilman, William C. Gilman, Maria P. Gilman and Emily S. Gilman. Edward W.\nGilman died in 1900, leaving surviving him two children, Caroline T. and Julia S., and the issue of Arthur C. a deceased child. Arthur C. Gilman died in 1890, leaving two children, Lawrence Gilman and Joseph Gilman. Caroline T. Gilman is now living and unmarried. Julia S. Gilman is now living and is the widow of Eugene S. Bristol. Elizabeth G. Thompson died in 1892, leaving a son, W. Gilman Thompson, as her only descendant. Daniel C. Gilman died in 1908, leaving two daughters, Elizabeth and Alice; the latter is the wife of Everett P. Wheeler. William C. Gilman died on or about March 30th, 1922, leaving two sons, George H. Gilman and Francis Gilman, surviving him.\n\nWith the exception of the period of approximately seven months during which she was married to George W. Lane, Louisa G. Lane had her home during the entire period from and after 1863 down to the date of her death, in the house at 380 Washington Street, Norwichtown, Connecticut. This house was owned at the time of her death by Eliza Coit Gilman, mother of Louisa G. Lane, and was by the will of Eliza Coit Gilman devised equally to Maria P. Gilman, Emily S. Gilman and Louisa G. Lane, all of whom were living at the date of the death of Eliza Coit Gilman. The house was also the home of Maria P. Gilman and Emily S. Gilman after 1863 up to the dates of their respective deaths, and was also occupied by William C. Gilman from approximately 1900 down to the date of his death. This house served as a common meeting ground for the various members of the Gilman family, and family gatherings were held there from time to time. The sisters, Maria, Emily and Louisa, were always ready there to extend hospitality to the children and grandchildren of their deceased brothers and sister; and all of the sisters, and particularly Louisa G. Lane, repeatedly expressed the wish that the house should always be maintained\nand kept open for family gatherings and well understood that this was impossible without an appropriation for such purpose.\n\nLouisa G. Lane received, as the survivor of a group consisting of herself and Maria P. Gilman and Emily S. Gilman, a large proportion of the property of which she was the owner at the time of her death under the will of her uncle, Joshua Coit. The will of Joshua Coit left the residue of his estate to his nieces Maria P. Gilman, Emily S. Gilman and Louisa G. Gilman (the testatrix) \"jointly to them, and the survivors and survivor of them, and the heirs of the survivor.\" Joshua Coit also left with his will two certain papers or memoranda, by which he informed his nieces that the income of the sum given them in his will was intended in the first place for their \"greater comfort, convenience of hospitality and independence, the principal after your life to go to your brothers and sisters and their families, as you think judicious and provide by will.\" He further stated to them that the ordinary way to effectuate such an intention was to create a trust wherein trustees are required by law strictly to carry out the provisions made by the donor, and that had he pursued this latter course he would have selected his nieces in preference to all others, but that questions arise in a strict trust which are often embarrassing and consequently recourse to courts may be necessary, and that such questions could better be solved by his nieces by carrying out in good faith the main object of the bequest. The testatrix knew of the will of Joshua Coit and of the memoranda above referred to, and was acquainted with their terms and phraseology. The testatrix kept the property received by her under the will of Joshua Coit as a separate fund.\n\nThe testatrix was upon very friendly terms on November 17th, 1919, and at all times prior and subsequent\nthereto, with all of her relatives, and especially with all of the defendants and their respective families: and for several years prior thereto she had been contributing to the support of her niece, the defendant Caroline T. Gilman, and her nephew, the defendant Francis Gilman. About the year 1915, she caused her nephew George H. Gilman to draw a will according to her instructions, and he sent her from New York to Norwich an original draft and a carbon copy thereof, a copy whereof appears in the record marked Exhibit H. She executed the original draft as her last will and testament, which will she subsequently destroyed. In the year 1919, she sent to George H. Gilman, in New York, the carbon copy, Exhibit H, with instructions to draw another will, making certain specified changes. He made a draft of a will according to said instructions, a copy of which appears in the record marked Exhibit I, and sent it to her. She never executed it, but not long after executed her last will and testament.\n\nThe following questions are propounded for the advice of this court: &#8212;\n\n\"a. Whether or not the executors named in the will of Louisa G. Lane who have qualified are entitled under the seventh article of said will to the residue of said estate absolutely and in fee simple for their own use free of any trust or obligation.\n\n\"b. Whether or not said executors hold said residue upon a trust, and if so what is the nature of such trust and who are the beneficiaries thereof.\n\n\"c. Whether or not said executors hold said residue impressed with a trust, but a trust which is too vague and indefinite to be enforceable, so that the heirs at law and next of kin are entitled to said residue as intestate estate.\n\n\"d. As to who is entitled to said residue, and in what proportions.\"\n\nThe three executors, in their personal capacity as defendants, and the defendant Elizabeth Gilman, claim that the residue disposed of in the seventh article of the will vests absolutely in the executors who qualified, free from any trust or obligation, and that the seventh paragraph is not void or inoperative and the residue is not intestate estate.\n\nThe other defendants claim that the seventh article of the will vests no beneficial interest in the residue; that the executors do not take the residue absolutely; that said residue is impressed with a trust which is too vague and indefinite to be enforceable, and that the residue should be divided according to the provisions of the statute of distributions.\n\nFurther facts appear in the opinion.", "procedural_history": "", "scdb_id": "", "sibling_ids": [3322806], "source": "ZU", "status": "Published", "suitNature": "", "syllabus": ""}

{"absolute_url": "/opinion/3541289/martin-v-bd-of-suprs-of-winston-co/", "attorney": "Z.A. Brantley,  of Louisville, and  L.F. Easterling,  of Jackson, for appellant.\n\nWe take the position that the order of the board calling the election was but a preliminary step to the holding of the election, and that, whereas it is true, as held in the Mohundro case,  165 So. 124 , that any taxpayer\ncould have appealed from the order of the board calling the election, still they did not have to do so, but could wait until the election was held and then, at a meeting of the board which attempted to declare the result of the election and to put the proposition in force in the county, that all questions on the consideration of this matter could be brought up before the board to show that it had acted without jurisdiction, and that the necessary facts upon which the jurisdiction was attempted to be exercised for calling the election did not, in fact, exist. In other words, to show that twenty per cent of the qualified electors of said county had not signed the petition.\n\nBryant v. Board of Supervisors,  133 Miss. 714 , 98 So. 148.\n\nIt will be observed that the order of the board ordering the election, of date March 4, 1937, does not sufficiently show on its face the jurisdictional facts prerequisite to the order of the election.\n\nWe contend that this court will take judicial notice of the votes polled in the 1935 primary election for officers, as contained in the reports of the Secretary of State, in Jackson, Mississippi. The information given to us by the Secretary of State on this question shows that on candidates for Governor for the first primary for Winston County the votes amounted to 6,064, and on the second primary to 5,993. As we counted the signers on these petitions in the record, there appear to be 1,205 signers. We think it is manifest from a consideration of the evidence of the circuit clerk before the board of supervisors that the board did not consider all of the names signed in the same handwriting.\n\nWe further call the court's attention to the fact that the board does not attempt in said order to find from evidence, such as the poll books of the county, the registration books and the sheriff's books, how many were qualified to vote in Winston County and how many\nqualified electors had signed the petitions in their own handwriting. The board can only act as a board upon the evidence brought before them or acquired by them jointly in an examination of the records to determine these necessary jurisdictional facts. Their mere ordering \"that the said petition is properly signed by twenty per centum or more of the qualified electors\" in our opinion on the face of the order is not sufficient, and for that reason the order is null and void.\n\nSimpson County v. Burkett,  172 So. 329 ; Lowndes County v. Ottley,  112 So. 466 ,  146 Miss. 118 ; Ferguson v. Monroe County, 71 Miss. 524 .\n\nIt is the policy of the law that the fullest hearing may be had on all questions and especially, as said in the Monroe case supra, where the effect of the election would be so momentous as to make that illegal which had been legal before, and to deprive petitioners who were licensed of their rights under their licenses and under the law to sell their products, the fullest inquiry should have been allowed by the board of supervisors; and, if it was determined that the petitions were not signed by the requisite twenty per cent of the qualified electors, all of the proceedings of the board should be vacated, and set aside and held for naught.\n\nWe think it cannot be questioned and will not be denied that no person can sign the names of other persons to said petition, with or without their consent.\n\nFerguson case,  71 Miss. 536 .\n\nThe notice of election in this case purported to have been given by the board of supervisors and the chancery clerk, and not by the election commissioners.\n\nEither it was necessary for the board of supervisors, under Section 310 of the Code of 1930, to prescribe the notice, give the notice and hold the election, or for the board to adjudge the jurisdictional facts, and order the election, and issue a writ of election to the election commissioners, who, under the general law (registration\nand election), are required to give the notice of the election and to hold the election and report the election as required by the general law.\n\nBurkett case,  172 So. 329 .\n\nIn the instant case, the board followed neither Sections 310 and 311, nor Section 6265, nor 6263 and other cognate statutes under Chapter 157, on Registration and Election of the Code of 1930.\n\nJames v. Wilkinson County,  150 Miss. 489 ,  117 So. 111 .\n\nGiving weight to that part of Chapter 171 of the Laws of 1934 \"that, if any county, in an election held for that purpose under the general election laws of the state,\" and provided further that an election to determine whether such transportation, etc., of such beverages shall be excluded from any county in the state shall, on a petition of twenty per centum (20%) of the duly qualified voters in such county, be ordered by the board of supervisors thereof for such county only. It would, therefore, appear that it was the Legislature's intention and purpose that the election to be held under such section was to be held and conducted under the election laws of the state. These are set out under the head of \"Registration and Election,\" Chapter 157 of the Code of 1930.\n\nIt seems apparent that the board of supervisors should order the election, issue the writ of election, and prescribe the form of the ballot, and, of course, receive the report of the election and pass the necessary order putting the proposition into operation in the county.\n\nThe board of supervisors did not find the jurisdictional facts. The board of supervisors did not issue that writ of election to the election commissioners, and did not provide that a certified copy of the order be delivered to the election commissioners. The board directed the clerk of the board to give the notice, instead of requiring the notice to be given by the proper officials, to-wit, the election commissioners.\n\nGreen v. Board of Suprs., Adams County,  161 So. 139 ,  172 Miss. 573 .\n\nThe board did not prescribe the form of the ballot, as provided for by Section 311 of the Code of 1930.\n\nThe fact that the notice attempted to be given is attempted to be signed by the board of supervisors of Winston County by Claude Richardson, president of the board of supervisors, would add no validity thereto, because not shown on the minutes that the form of the notice was prepared, adopted, and shown on the minutes as the notice of the board to be given by the board; and, therefore, on this theory the order would be null and void.\n\nSections 310 and 6256, Code of 1930.\n\nSection 310 is silent as to the kind of notice. The order of the board is silent as to the kind of notice to be given by the clerk. Therefore, we claim that, since the election on the beer question was to be held under the general election laws of the state, it was the intent and purpose of the Legislature that the voters should have all the notice possible, so that they might intelligently prepare themselves to ballot on the question, and that the Legislature in its wisdom contemplated that writ of election should be given under the election laws to the election commissioners, and that they, the election commissioners, should give the notice of the election as prescribed in Section 6265, as that best calculated to give the qualified electors of each precinct notice of the matter to be presented to them, \"posting notice at the courthouse and at each election district in the county for as near thirty days as may be practicable; and the election shall be prepared for and held as in the case of a general election.\"\n\nSmythe v. Whitehead,  133 Miss. 184 , 97 So. 529; Cameron v. Whittington,  120 Miss. 595 , 82 So. 311.\n\nThe board failed to issue a writ of election as contemplated by Section 6265 of the Code of 1930.\n\nThe order of May 4, 1937, attempting to declare the\nresults of the election and to exclude said beverages from said county is null and void, because said order shows on its face that the said election was not ordered, held, conducted, and notice thereof given for the time and in the manner required by law.\n\nLaying aside the question that might be raised that the power to tax and raise revenue, vested in the Legislature by the people, cannot be delegated back to the people, or defeated by any vote of the people, which it seems to us is a serious question, we still say that, inasmuch as some of the exceptors had state licenses for the sale of such beverages, issued under a different law of the Legislature imposing such privilege licenses, the Legislature itself could not delegate to the people of a county the right to abrogate or repeal any act of the Legislature.\n\nTherefore, it necessarily follows, as the day follows the night, that the said act is unconstitutional, in that it attempts to vest in the qualified electors of a county the right and power to repeal another act, to-wit, the act imposing the privilege tax for the sale of the beverages.\n\nState v. Harvey, 170 So. 154.\n\nThe point we are making here is that, inasmuch as the Legislature, under Chapter 127, Laws of 1934, imposed a privilege license for selling such beverages and fixed the amount thereof, and provided that the special licenses should authorize a licensee to conduct said business for twelve months, the Legislature itself could not delegate to the qualified electors of a county the right to repeal this chapter imposing a license, and that as long as any licenses to sell such beverages existed in the county, the result of the election could not take away from the holder of such license the right conferred by a different act of the Legislature to continue in said business.\n\nState v. Harvey, 170 So. 155.\n\nThe proviso of this act attempting to give to the voters\nof any county the right to exclude the sale of the beverages and to make it illegal in any county is a clear legislative attempt to pass back to the people the power to make and repeal laws. It is a plain surrender of the lawmaking power to the people, contrary to the forms of democratic government and contrary to Section 33 of the Constitution. It seems to us that no other construction is justified.\n\nState v. Harvey, 170 So. 156; Olds v. State,  101 Fla. 218 , 133 So. 641 ; 1 Cooley on Constitutional Limitations, (8 Ed.) page 242; Parker v. Commonwealth,  6 Pa. 507 , 47 Am. Dec. 480; State v. Geebreck,  5 Iowa 49 ; Thorne v. Kramer, 15 Barlow 112.\n\nThe order of March 4, 1937, is null and void on its face, in that it does not sufficiently adjudicate the jurisdictional facts, which under the law gave the board the power to proceed.\n\nRobb v. Postal Tel. Co., 61 So. 170,  104 Miss. 165 ; Merchants Bank v. Scott County,  165 Miss. 91 ,  145 So. 908 ; Oliver v. Baird, 90 Miss. 718 , 44 So. 35; Monroe County v.

Strong, Jr.,  of Louisville, for appellee.\n\nWe earnestly insist that the order of the board does sufficiently adjudicate the jurisdictional fact that 20% or more of the qualified electors of Winston County had signed the petitions calling for said election.\n\nPeoples Bank v. Attala County,  126 So. 192 ; Noxubee County v. Long,  106 So. 83 .\n\nAppellants contend that the order of the board of supervisors ordering the election should recite the evidence\nupon which the jurisdictional facts were found to exist. This contention of appellants has been decided adverse to them by the Supreme Court of Mississippi in the case of Johnson v. Board of Supervisors, 74 So. 321.\n\nClanton v. Board of Supervisors,  145 So. 108 .\n\nWe most sincerely insist that the order passed by the board of supervisors ordering the election to be held, when judged according to the rule of the foregoing decisions of this court, sufficiently sets out the jurisdictional fact necessary to make it a valid order.\n\nFerguson v. Board of Suprs., Monroe County, 14 So. 81; Moore v. Board of Suprs.,  118 So. 349 ; Power v. Robertson,  130 Miss. 188 , 93 So. 769; Corbett v. Duncan,  63 Miss. 84 ; Loeb v. Duncan, 63 Miss. 89 ; Rogers v. Hahn,  63 Miss. 578 .\n\nWe respectfully submit that under the rulings of the court in the above cases, the order of the board of supervisors of Winston County was a final order from which an appeal by bill of exceptions could have been taken or by certiorari. We further contend that the appellants, at the March meeting of the board of supervisors, could have introduced evidence to show that the petitions did not contain the required number of names and if the board decided against them, they could have appealed to the circuit court by bill of exceptions, provided the bill of exceptions was presented to the board at the March meeting but they could not appeal by bill of exceptions after the March meeting. Of course, at any time within six months from the March meeting they could have by certiorari appealed from the order of the board and had the record brought up to the circuit court.\n\nMagee v. Jones,  63 Miss. 453 ; Hathorn v. Morgan, 65 So. 643; Board of Suprs., Marshall County v. Stevenson,  134 So. 142 , 160 Miss. 372 .\n\nIt is the contention of the appellees in this case that the appellants having failed to present the bill of exceptions to the president of the board of supervisors\nduring the March meeting at which the order complained of was passed, that they lost their right to appeal by bill of exceptions as provided by Section 61 of the Code of 1930, and that they could not later by again going before the board and having the board enter another order, appeal from this later order by bill of exceptions.\n\nRobinson v. Board of Supervisors, 65 So. 461,  107 Miss. 352 .\n\nWe would respectfully call the court's attention to the fact that after the election of 1935 our corrupt practice law was passed, which disqualified more than 50% of the voters in this county. If this Honorable Court will take judicial notice of the number of votes polled in the election in Winston County, then we submit, that it will take judicial notice of the fact that the number of votes polled on August 25, 1936, in the senatorial and congressional election was 2598 in this county.\n\nThe beer election which is being contested in this law suit was held on the 20th day of April, 1937; therefore, the number of qualified electors in Winston County in 1936 would be more accurate than the number in 1935, for the reason that after the 1935 election the corrupt practice law was passed.\n\nThe record in this case, we think, conclusively shows that the board of supervisors in checking the names of the qualified electors who had signed the petition did not count those names that were not signed in the petitioners' own handwriting, therefore the question of whether the names signed in someone else's handwriting could be counted is not material; however, we would call the court's attention to the fact that Section 2, Chapter 171 of the Laws of 1934 does not require that the petitions be signed in the handwriting of the petitioners, but simply says that the election should be ordered by the board of supervisors \"on a petition of twenty per centum (20%) of the duly qualified voters in such county.\"\n\nWe think it was entirely correct for the notice of this election to have been given by the board of supervisors instead of by the election commissioners and in this connection we would direct the court's attention to the case of Simpson County v. Burkett,  172 So. 329 . In said case the court held that an election under the provisions of Section 2, Chapter 171 of the Laws of 1934 is controlled by Sections 310 and 311 of the Mississippi Code of 1930 and expressly said that \"there are no other statutes to which resort may be had with any assurance and dependability as to closeness of analogy as these two as respects the submission to the voter of a county wide proposition of the nature of that herein involved.\"\n\nSections 310 and 311, Code of 1930.\n\nWe submit that under the provisions of Section 310 of the Code, it was the duty of the board of supervisors to call this election and to give the notice of same.\n\nPerkins v. Carroway,  59 Miss. 222 ; 9 R.C.L. 993.\n\nOur court has repeatedly held that in the absence of fraud, if an election is fairly conducted, mere irregularities will not invalidate the result.\n\nState v. Greer,  130 So. 482 ; Pradat v. Ramsey,  47 Miss. 24 ; Fullwood v. State,  67 Miss. 554 , 7 So. 432; Shines v. Hamilton, 87 Miss. 384 , 29 So. 1008.\n\nIt seems to us to be a very serious question as to whether or not appellants have any right to question the constitutionality of this act, for the reason, that the record, we think, shows that none of the appellants had a state license to sell beer and they were all operating in violation of law.\n\nWith reference as to whether or not Section 2, Chapter 171 of the Laws of 1934 violates Section 17 of the Constitution of Mississippi of 1890 or is unconstitutional, for the reason, that exceptors have vested rights in their beer license and equipment which are protected by the constitution. In this connection, we would respectfully direct the court's attention to Vol. 15 R.C.L. under the\nheading of intoxicating liquors where the following rule is laid down on page 285: \"One who accepts a license must be deemed to consent to all proper conditions and restrictions which have been or may be imposed by the legislature in the interest of public morals and safety relative to the traffic or to the place in which he sells. In other words, the licensee takes subject to the reasonable exercise of the police power. The license is not a contract between the government and the licensee, and it creates no vested rights, any more than does the charter of the social club create rights beyond revocation for violation of the liquor laws; nor can any vested rights be created under a license by the acquisition and use of the instrumentalities necessary to the business.\"\n\n15 R.C.L. 336; 33 C.J. 509; Reed v. Beale,  42 Miss. 472 ; Coulson v. Harris,  43 Miss. 728 .\n\nThe question as to whether or not Chapter 171 of the Laws of 1934 is in conflict with Section 33 in that the provisions of said statute constitutes an unlawful delegation of the legislative power to the people is not properly before the court. The appellants did not raise this point in their pleadings nor did they argue this point before the board of supervisors or the circuit court; in fact, the first time that anything has been said in this case with reference to this statute being an unlawful delegation of legislative power or violative of Section 33 of the Constitution was when the able brief prepared by appellants was filed. We contend that having failed to raise this point in the lower court, appellants are not now in a position to have it considered on this appeal.\n\nAdams v. Bd. of Suprs., Union County,  170 So. 684 .\n\nThe constitutionality of local option laws has been most strongly assailed on the ground that they delegate legislative power to the people, and consequently conflict with the constitutional provisions which vest all legislative powers in the legislature. Both sides to the controversy practically agree that the legislature cannot\nabdicate the law-making power, nor delegate that power to the people. And both sides also agree that the legislature may pass laws to take effect on a future contingency. The question on which the difference of opinion exists is whether such laws do or do not delegate to the people the power, direct or indirect, of making laws. (Citing State v. Wilcox,  42 Conn. 364 , 19 Am. Rep. 536; Gordon v. State,  46 Ohio St. 617 , 23 N.E. 63, 6 L.R.A. 749). As might be expected, many exceedingly refined and artificial, if not specious arguments have been made on both sides of the question but on a review of the decisions, it appears that the better reason and the majority of the cases, which increase as time goes on, favor the side of constitutionality.
